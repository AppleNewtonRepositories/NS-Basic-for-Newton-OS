Software Update for users of NS BASIC 3.0The enclosed diskette contains NS BASIC 3.02, with important enhancements and fixes.The changes in 3.02 are:1. Support for block IF THEN ELSE END IF added. This new structure simplifies program coding. It's most easily demonstrated in this code sample:0010 IF 1=2 THEN0020   print "Equal"0030 ELSE0040   print "Not Equal"0050 END IF2. Support for DO loops added. With this, GOTO-less programming becomes possible: NS BASIC can be programmed according to structured programming techniques. The new statements are:DO (by itself, or followed by WHILE <condition> or UNTIL <condition>: This statement starts the loop.LOOP (by itself, or followed by WHILE <condition> or UNTIL <condition>: This statement ends the loop.EXIT DO allows you to exit at any point inside the loop.Example:0010 i=00020 DO0030  i=i+10040  if i>5 then EXIT DO0050 LOOP UNTIL i=10In the above example, the loop will execute until i is equal to 6. The value in the loop will not reach 10, so the condition in line 50 will not be triggered.3. An EXIT FOR statement has been added to end FOR/NEXT loops early.Example:0010 FOR i=1 to 100020   print i0030   if i=5 then EXIT FOR0040 NEXT i0050 print "done"This program prints the numbers from 1 to 5 and the word "done".4. To use handwriting to program, tap "next lineNo in Edit Box" in the Statements popup. It will bring up the next line number. The edit box supports all normal handwriting characters and gestures. 5. The DatePicker defaults to the current date, not that date NS BASIC was built.6. Documentation update: If you add your buttons to the bar at the bottom of the App s widget, tapping the info button will cause the info to be displayed behind your buttons.  7. Reinstalling NS BASIC no longer causes an Error 77 message and a reset.8. Documentation Update: NS BASIC uses the same variable space for both itself and any packages that have been made using NS BASIC. This means care must be taken if two NS BASIC programs are to be active at the same time. This will be changed in a future rev.9. Under the Info button, the Help and Prefs selections no longer error.10. Certain widgets were displaying without a SHOW command being issued. The SHOW command is now required for all widgets. If you assumed they were not needed in your programs, you'll need to modify your code. The widgets affected are: CHECKBOX, RCHECKBOX, GAUGE, LABELINPUT, MONTH, PARAGRAPH, SETCLOCK, SLIDER, TEXT, DATEPICKER, DIGITALCLOCK, NUMBERPICKER, PICTUREBUTTON, AZTABS, AZVERTABS and NEWSETCLOCK. By having this work consistently, programs have better control over windows.11. The Edit box is now draggable.12. When operating in Serial mode, the INPUT statement now works properly (a CR is no longer added to the end of the input).13. The MAKEPACKAGE command now handles real constants (i.e. 3.4) correctly.14. The MAKEPACKAGE command now handles frame expressions with more than 20 elements correctly.15. When NS BASIC is chained to from another application, it now runs silently if no data is output while NS BASIC is running.16. The Command and Statement pop up lists have been enhanced to include many of the new commands and statements.17. The IR communications are still broken: we are waiting for new platform files from Apple which should help.Changes in 3.011. FOR/NEXT can now use an array or frame element as its index.2. The Alpha/Numeric button has been dropped from the HWINPUT statement. With the improved recognition of Newton OS 2.0, it's not necessary.3. Certain widgets (such as DatePicker) were getting evt.ex -8502 messages when being created.4. The SHOW command now checks that the arguments are integers. HIDE has always done this.5. The CLOSEBOX and LARGECLOSEBOX defaulted to be visible: they automatically SHOWed without the show command being issued. This resulted in them appearing under other windows when they should have been on top. They now require a SHOW command to display.6. If a widget does not exist, a better message is produced.7. The fax number for NS BASIC on the info screen has been corrected (416 264 5888)
