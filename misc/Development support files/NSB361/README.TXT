It provides bug fixes and enhancements to theNS BASIC 3.6. Be sure to download each of NSBASIC.PKG, Runtime, VisualDesigner and MakePackage: they are designed to work together.NS BASIC 3.6 with Visual Designer is a complete implementation of theBASIC programming language, with extensions to take advantage of the richNewton environment. As well as having the ability to layout and customizewindow objects graphically, it features the ability to create standaloneroyalty-free Newton packages, indexed files, serial and infrared communications, scientific and graphic functions, and many other powerfulfeatures.NS BASIC is commercial software, available directly from NS BASIC or itsresellers. The price is $99.95 USD.For the latest news on NS BASIC, check our web site at www.nsbasic.com.
