I've been working with the new document, "Newton Formats Version 1.0", and found it to be pretty disappointing. In particular, the section on the format for package parts is wholly inadequate. (Pages 1-8 to 1-13).Working with Dave Fedor at the conference (help much appreciated), I was able to develop better information. However, I still have a number of questions. Please pardon my use of terminology here: I have to call things what they look like to me, not knowing what their proper names are.1. The specification frame for a frame slot name has a hashed value in its 4th long word. How is this calculated offically?      00 00 17 40 00 00 00 00 00 05 55 52 18 10 F3 5F ...@......UR..ó_      73 74 72 69 6E 67 00 BF                         string.¿2. Sometimes arrays have 12 byte headers and sometimes 16. Even 8. Why? 120: 00 00 10 41 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 02 00 00 01 31 ...A...........1  280: 00 00 1C 41 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 02 ...A............ 290: 00 00 02 A1 00 00 02 B9 00 00 02 D1 BF BF BF BF ...¡...¹...Ñ¿¿¿¿ 8A0: 00 00 14 41 00 00 00 00 00 00 08 B9 00 00 08 D1 ...A.......¹...Ñ 8B0: 00 00 09 B9 BF BF BF BF
