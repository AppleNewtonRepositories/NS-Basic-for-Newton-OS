TXTxfer--------This is a rough hack of a text file transfer utility. It works, but without a lot of fail safe stuff for communications. It seems to work reliably with a direct connection to a mac: if there are problems, try doing a reset of the Newton.Use----1. Start a terminal emulation program on your host.2. Start TXTxfer.3. Tap Send or Receive4. If Receive, transfer your file to the serial port of your PC. Settings are 9600/8/1/n. The first record should be the name of the file you want to create on the Newton, followed by as many <cr> delimited records as you want, followed by BYE! <cr>. Records are a maximum of 1000 characters long.5. If Send, select the name of the file you want to send from the menu. All text files are suffixed by ".TXT", and are the only ones shown. The layout of these records is {recNo: integer, text: string}. Settings are 2400/8/1/n. Records are a maximum of 1000 characters long.That's all there is to it.What to do with this hack-----------------------I'm not sure. I'd like its format to be as widely used as possible, for no particular reason other than I think something like this is needed. For this reason, I'd like to put the hack and its source into the public domain. I don't have time right now to finish it off properly: do you know a candidate for the job?It also needs work.1. Better error recovery. The version is mostly cobbled together from pieces of Slurp and Pour, both little more than example programs. I don't think there's enough recovery from wierd problems built in.2. Support for modems.3. Add a TXT file viewer. This is actually a killer app by itself: I get asked by lots of people if there's a way they can download reference documents to look at later. Sure, the Bookmaker is designed for this, but how many people have and want to use it just to download a sample contract or a report? With this tool, it becomes fairly trivial.4.	Add a delete file button to clean up unwanted TXT files.
