Newton    *       *         2.0, the operating system for Apple's MessagePad personal                      digital assistant (PDA) as well as devices from Newtonlicensees, won "Best of COMDEX" in the "Operating System" category. The coveted"Best of COMDEX" awards presented annually by Byte Magazine recognize unique,technically innovative and cutting-edge new computer products at COMDEX, thelargest computer tradeshow in the United States. "This prestigious award is a testament to the great strides we've made inproviding a PDA platform which offers customers enhanced personal computerintegration, communications and organization capabilities," said Steve Andler,senior director of Mobile Products for Apple Computer. "The enormous supportfrom developers, licensees, and system integrators, combined with the newfunctionality of the operating system, makes Newton 2.0 among the mostcompelling PDA platforms on the market today for mobile professionals andvertical markets alike." "Newton 2.0 marks what could become the turning point for the platform," saidKimball Brown, vice president, Mobile Computing, Dataquest. "The newcapabilities in Newton 2.0 are vastly improved over the previous version,providing new ways for developers to add functionality for customers." Newton 2.0 is a major revision and refinement of the Newton operating systemand is the result of more than two years of extensive customer feedback anduser testing. It is designed to advance the Newton platform by providingimproved organizational and communications capabilities, as well as the abilityto integrate Newton PDAs with Windows and Mac OS-based personal computers andenterprise environments. The Newton 2.0 platform is also designed to provide amore flexible and extensible development environment for a growing number ofpartners and solutions providers, including independent software vendors(ISVs), systems integrators (SIs), and value-added resellers (VARs). Last week in the Newton Pavilion, Apple's dedicated Newton booth at COMDEX,licensees such as Digital Ocean, Inc., Harris Corp. and Motorola Corp. showedconnectivity solutions for mobile professionals and vertical markets. Inaddition, more than 40 developers demonstrated over 50 different softwaresolutions, illustrating the power and versatility of the Newton 2.0 platform. Newton 2.0 is expected to be available on the Apple MessagePad 120 beginningDecember 1, 1995. Additional Newton 2.0 products that focus on giving customersthe power to connect with their personal computers and enterprise structuresare expected to be available in the marketplace over the next two quarters. Product Availability^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Existing customers in the United States will be able to upgrade theirMessagePad 120 (1MB & 2MB versions with the Newton 1.3 operating system) withthe new operating system for $109 beginning in December. For those customerswith earlier MessagePad products (the original model and models 100 and 110),Apple also will implement a customer appreciation rebate program beginning onDecember 1. Owners of earlier models who buy a MessagePad 120 with the newoperating system will receive a $100 rebate by sending in proof of purchase andthe serial number from the early model. Customers may call the NewtonInformation Service at: (800) 909-0260 for the rebate program, or the AppleAssistance Center at: (800) 767-2775 to place orders for the upgrade program(beginning Dec. 1st), locate the nearest reseller, or receive additionalinformation about Newton programs. Apple Computer, Inc., a recognized pioneer and innovator in the informationindustry, creates powerful solutions based on easy-to-use personal computers,servers, peripherals, software, on-line services, and personal digitalassistants.

This involves the    |_________|          coordination of many issues and requirements, both                         mechanical and non-mechanical.  We have ongoingdiscussions with Marketing, Electrical Hardware, Software, Reliability andManufacturing (to name a few) on specific requirements and constraints.Working closely with Apple's award-winning Industrial Design Group, wetransform these requirements and constraints into a physical form. As a Product Designer you focus on striking a balance between issues whichsatisfy the user and those that satisfy the business end.  Ideally a product'stechnology should be transparent to the user, cost close to nothing and beaesthetically pleasing.  On the other hand, the product must be manufacturable,reliable and profitable. Specifically, issues such as ergonomics, material selection, part design,component specification, manufacturing process, cost and cosmetics are alldealt with concurrently by the Product Designer.  For Apple labeled Newtonsystems, the goal is to make the smallest, lowest-priced product which stillhas all the features required by the user. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^o   MARKETING FRONT   KOREY MCCORMACK, NEWTON PRODUCT MARKETING              XX             XX       Q: What is the Apple MessagePad 120 Upgrade Program?            XX        A: An upgrade program to the Newton 2.0 operating      XX   XX            system.        XXX                      Q: Who Can Upgrade?                      A: Customers who own a MessagePad 120 1MB or 2MB.Q: What is Included?A: The following items are included in the upgrade:   -Newton 2.0   -Newton Backup Utility for Macintosh or Windows   -Serial Cables (if required)   -Data Backup and Restore instructions   -MessagePad 120 User's Guide   -Notion 1.2   -Notion 1.2 User's Guide   -Pocket Quicken 1.2 Upgrade Offer   -Newton Solutions Guide   -StarCore Product Usability List Q: How Does it Work?A: To order the MessagePad 120 Upgrade, dial 1-800-767-2775.  You will bedirected through a phone tree and should select the MessagePad 120 Upgradeoption.  An operator will be available to take your order.  Have the serialnumber of your MessagePad 120 ready (located on the inside of the batterycompartment) as well as a credit card number.  You will be asked what kind ofcomputer you use and if you will require serial cables. Once the order has been placed, the Apple Service Center will mail an upgradekit to you with all of the above items as well as a shipping box with a prepaidFedEx mailing label.  You will be responsible for backing up all data alreadyon your MessagePad 120 1.x device BEFORE you mail the unit in to be upgraded asthe upgrade process will erase all the 1.x data.  Apple will not be responsiblefor any lost data. Once the MessagePad 120 1.x unit arrives at the Apple Service Center, it willtake 2-5 working days to perform the upgrade and return the upgraded unit backto you.  (December orders may experience a delay of 5-10 working days due tothe holidays). Because of the enhanced features and improvements to the Newton 2.0 operatingsystem, some software applications written for the Newton 1.x operating systemmay not work or may experience some problems.  A StarCore Product UsabilityList is included in the upgrade kit to reference.

Theresult has been the development of two products:  a data collection programcalled FieldWorker and a Global Positioning System (GPS) API for Newtondevelopers. FieldWorker allows someone using a PDA to collect data in the field, match itautomatically with location information taken from a Global Positioning System(GPS) receiver, and later export that data to a desktop computer.  The guidingprincipal in its development has been to keep everything generic.  In otherwords, FieldWorker is designed to work on any Newton PDA, on any GPS unit witha serial port, on any desktop operating system and on any desktop program sothat the customer can make choices appropriate to his requirements and budget. While developing its product, FieldWorker Products found that althoughNewtonScript is a coherent, easy to work with, well-supported programmingenvironment, GPS is not.  Developed by the US Department of Defense (DOD), theGPS system works on the basis of radio signals which are sent from orbitingsatellites.  The accuracy with which these signals can be interpreted isdependent upon atmospheric and terrestrial conditions as well as SelectiveAvailability (SA), a fudge factor added by the DOD to decrease accuracy.  Thelatitude and longitude resulting from the interpretation of these signalsand the communications protocol used are dependent upon the GPS receiver that'sbeing used.  In addition, FieldWorker Products has learned that Russia willstart to supply its own commercial satellite navigation option called GLONASS.In response to these discoveries, FieldWorker Products has developed anotherproduct: an API available for developers who want to include positionalinformation in their products without the need to dealing with these types ofissues. For more information on FieldWorker Products Limited or to discuss linkingNewton products, contact Sandy by telephone at (416) 483-3485, by fax at (416)483-7069, by e-mail at fieldworker@fieldworker.com, or via the Web athttp://www.fieldworker@fieldworker.com. WRIGHT STRATEGIES^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Wright Strategies, a San Diego, CA based company, develops and marketstools and services that allow programmers and non-programmers to createsolutions for field force automation utilizing PDA technology. Wright Strategies is fast becoming the leading supplier of developmenttools for the Newton platform through its FormLogic products.  FormLogicconsists of a suite of applications that facilitate the development,deployment, and integration of field force automation applications.  TheFormLogic Builder allows developers to quickly build applications onWindows or Mac OS-based computers.  The FormLogic Server, also availablefor both platforms, is used to distribute these applications to PDA devicesin the field equipped with the FormLogic client.  FormLogic supportscommunications via serial cable, modem, cellular, and wireless LAN devices. Form design is reduced to the assembling of a series of "agents" capable ofcollecting data types including text, number, digital ink, bar code, andmagnetic strip via entry methods including check boxes, radio buttons,progress bars, pick lists, and open ended entry.  Add to this FormLogic'spowerful yet simple scripting language and you have a system which providessophisticated form navigation and data validation, as well as context sensitivehelp.  FormLogic has now been implemented by over 1200 users at over 100customer sites. Wright Strategies has recently announced "Project Jumpstart", with theobjective of providing SIs, VARs, and corporate development programmerswith all the requisite components to "fast track" field force automationprojects. For more information on Wright Strategies' products, call (619)794-2494, fax(619)794-2497 or e-mail <sales@wrightstrat.com>. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^o  SI ACCESS            MP120 SLIDES       @@     @@  @@             o Are you an SI or VAR in need of a photo to use in       @@               your advertisements or datasheets?

New with Newton OS 2.0 and Newton Toolkit 1.6 is the           ??           ability to declare NewtonScript objects in one package         ??             and then use those objects in other packages.  Each                        application no longer has to have its own copy of         ??             anything that is not in the ROM. You can take advantage of this to modularize your applications.  Forexample, you can create a library of common protos, view templates, functions,pictures, or other data and share it among multiple 'front end' applications. The basis for this is the Unit Reference mechanism in the 2.0 OS.  Itallows an exporting application to "define" a set of NewtonScript arrays,frames, or binary objects.  Importers can "reference" all or a subset ofthese objects.  When a package is installed, the OS links up unboundreferences, either imported or exported.  External references must be declaredwhen an application is compiled, but there are routines available to discoverwhether or not an external reference is bound, so you can bulletproof yourcode. See the Newton 2.0 Q&As or the DTS sample code "Moo Unit" for details. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^o  LAUGH--              --AT US, NOT WITH US       (X  X)                        The following Call-of-the-Day was submitted by Apple      @@    @@          Assistance Center agent Barb Kelley in Sterling,                        Colorado:        @@@@                        "A man called in to say that his MessagePad would notpower on.

Most recently, Green Mountain Software teamed with Leica Inc. andApple to build applications that link DISTO, Leica's award-winning handheldelectronic measuring device, and the MessagePad.  The first offering for theMessagePad is DISTOPad, which allows users to record, annotate, print and storemeasurements on a "per job" basis, as well as perform area and volumecalculations. Today, Green Mountain Software products are in use and in development for homehealth professionals, printers, graphics designers and building inspectors, aswell as film and video producers, physicians, and the construction industry.Green Mountain Software was also the development partner for the newlyannounced Hurricane Software for Print Estimating, which was designed forprinters, graphic designers and ad agencies to significantly speed up theprocess of developing print estimates.  In addition, ClinPen (formerlyClinTrak), a home health care application developed by Green Mountain Softwarefor Medical Support Services, was named one of three finalists for the AppleEnterprise Awards in the Mobile Computing category. We congratulate Green Mountain Software on the quality of its systemsintegration software development and its commitment to the Newton platform! ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^o  TOP PROJECT       PA CONSULTING HELPS MAKE RAIL TRAVEL SAFER!   ***********        *     *      In 1987 British Rail had a major accident just to the        *     *      south of London when three trains collided with        * * *        considerable loss of life and many more seriously injured.        *            The accident was due to faulty workmanship on the        *            signalling system and prompted a major review of the way                     that engineers were trained and managed.  Now, beforeanyone can run a railway, they are required to prove that their staff iscompetent to undertake safety-critical tasks in the workplace.  Testingengineers in a training center is no longer sufficient.  They need to bechecked continually as they work.  However this is not easily done as thetrains run day and night and under all kinds of weather conditions. To solve the problem, British Rail asked PA Consulting to re-engineer thetraining system for its signalling technicians.  This was a major project whichcost almost $20 million and involved the production of 2000 hours of multimediatraining.  Next, a means to assess the day-to-day competence of British Rail'sstaff was needed, without adding to the workload of the supervisors.  Inresponse, PA Consulting developed a Newton application that combined aperformance support system with data collection on how well techniciansperformed their jobs.  The performance support system helps supervisorsdetermine exactly what to look for so they can note when the technicians dosomething corerectly.  The data, stamped with the date, time and supervisor'sidentification, is uploaded to a PC-based system that keeps records on thekinds of equipment each individual is licensed to work on, what qualificationsthey are entitled to, and when they need re-testing. Accidents and loss due to signalling faults once cost British Rail over$500 million each year.  A minor improvement in performance means that thesystem has paid for itself in months.  British Rail is now rolling out thesystem across the entire network, and supervisors are starting to use otherapplications developed by PA Consulting, such as health and safety checklists. For more information on PA Consulting contact Nick Rushby at +44 171 333 5399or Nick.Rushby@pa-consulting.com. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^o     CALENDAR          THE SYMPOSIUM IS ALMOST HERE!!     |X X X X X|     |# # # # #|        The next Annual Apple USA, Newton Symposium will be     |# # # # #|        held on Thursday, January 11, 1996.
