We work with a large number of organizations both insideand outside of NSG in order to accomplish this objective. Our day to day activities include establishing and tracking the projectschedule, identifying and resolving cross-functional issues, working withthird parties and vendors, and ensuring effective communications across allconstituents of the project.  I often describe a program manager's role asone who connects the dots to form a complete, cohesive picture. One of our biggest challenges is the careful balance of features, quality,resources and schedule.  This is where the program manager's ability to seethe big picture and the input from team members from various disciplinesbecomes invaluable. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^o   MARKETING FRONT   CRAIG SEARS-BLACK, NSG REGIONAL MANAGER, EUROPE              XX             XX       Q. What is your role within NSG Europe?            XX      XX   XX         A. The function of NSG Europe is to develop the sales of        XXX              Newton products in European markets.  There are three                         main elements to this; developing distributionchannels, managing demand generation programmes and building solutions throughstrategic relationships.  My role is to plan how we do that and then ensurethat the team has the resources, products and partners to succeed. Europe is a market with huge potential for PDA sales as the wireless datacommunications networks are so well developed and carriers see value addedservices as an important future revenue stream.  It does have its challenges asthe cultures and languages are so diverse.  While for practical reasons we needto treat Europe as a homogeneous market, we can't ignore these regionaldifferences.  So to be successful, we make certain that we have localrepresentation either directly or through exclusive distributors in all chiefregions. Our main growth this year will come from the German speaking regions where newtechnology is accepted far faster than any other region in Europe.  Thereforemuch of our investment will be in this market.  Any developer looking to expandoutside the USA would be advised to look first at this market as the potentialrewards are huge. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^o VENDOR SPLENDOR       ON TECHNOLOGY AND SHANA REVIEWED    VV       VV     VV     VV          ON TECHNOLOGY      VV   VV           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^       VV VV            ON Technology Corporation recently released its new        VVV             Newton Client for Meeting Maker XP.  Meeting Maker XP                        is the client/server group scheduling solution forMacintosh, Windows, OS/2, UNIX and DOS.  The latest version, Meeting Maker XP3.5, provides two-way synchronization between your MessagePad and your desktop. If you find yourself on the road a lot and don't have time to manage yourworkload when you get back in the office, the new Newton Client provides away to keep up with your schedule so it fits your habits and needs.  With theNewton Client you can propose meetings or change meeting proposals all fromyour MessagePad.  When you get back in the office and re-connect to yournetwork, the Newton Client will automatically synch up with your desktop andkeep you current.  Everything and everyone is kept current with your changes ina matter of moments.  For example, while you're away at a seminar you canschedule a meeting with your department to give them an overview of the seminarand then once you're back in the office automatically synch up to your desktop. The Newton Client works with MessagePad 120 and 130 (2.0 operating system).For more information about the new Newton Client for Meeting Maker XP, contactON Technology at (800) 548-8871. SHANA^^^^^In the Macintosh business for over 10 years, Shana Corporation is thedeveloper of the Informed(r) family of electronic forms software, includingInformed Designer(tm) and Informed Manager(r). Shana has just announced the release of Informed Filler for Newton, its mobileelectronic forms solution.

Kieren's company, Simon & Associates,        |===            specializes in writing custom software for commercial                        and industrial problems.  One such application is                        MiniStab, a solution created for the New Zealandfishing industry.  Developed by John Harrhy Consulting Ltd., New Zealand'slargest marine design firm, MiniStab aids ship captains in calculating a shipsstability in water.  Simon & Associates was commissioned by John HarrhyConsulting to develop a Newton version of an existing application forcalculating quicker, more reliable results from any location on the ship. Kieren's Newton Value Story was just one of many excellent stories we received.We commend Kieren for his commitment to the Newton platform!  Here's thewinning entry. *******************************************************************************Our company, John Harrhy Consulting Ltd., does naval architecture work for theNew Zealand fishing industry.  Over the last couple of years a dozen ships havesunk around the New Zealand coast, killing several people and costing millionsof dollars.  Most of these ships were lost not because of bad weather, butbecause of dangerous loading. The stability of a ship is very complex to determine, even for an experiencedskipper.  It takes about an hour with tables and a calculator to do a completestability profile of a ship, which is simply too long to be practical.  It isalso very easy to make a mistake somewhere in the calculations, which makes theresults hopelessly unreliable. We had already designed an application to do these calculations, but thesoftware required a full Windows PC to run - not always practical on a heavingvessel.  It was our programmer who first suggested converting the program torun on the MessagePad.  It didn't take long before the organization was firmlycommitted to developing a hand-held Newton version of the software. The program required some careful shuffling to compress the information from a14" color screen onto the monochrome MessagePad, but the finished resultsworked extremely well.  The pen interface was even easier to use than the mouseit replaced.  Crews can adjust the tanks and holds and immediately seegraphically how the ship will sit in water.  A ship's stability can berecalculated in just nine seconds.  The MessagePad also allows the skipper toperform calculations anywhere on the vessel, even during a power failure. We hope that one day all vessels will carry this type of safety equipment andthe days when ships routinely sank to the bottom will be a thing of the past.******************************************************************************* o Newton Symposium Video^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^If you'd like a copy of the 1996 Newton SI/VAR Symposium video, send us anemail at tapped.in@applelink.apple.com and we'll ship one to you. o 2.0 Apps^^^^^^^^^^Do you have a new 2.0 app?

Ryan Robertson - Newton DTS Engineer     ??     ??           ??           With the abundance of clone functions it can become a         ??             challenge to know which to use.  Here is a brief                        description of each function:         ??                        Clone(obj) - Makes and returns a "shallow" copy of an                        object.  References within the object are copied, butthe data pointed to by references is not.  Clone will not duplicate the framemap or class symbol for the new object.  They will be shared with the originalobject. (Refer to the Newton Programmer's Guide for more information aboutframe maps) DeepClone(obj) - Makes and returns a "deep" copy of an object.  All of the datareferenced within the object is copied, including that referenced by magicpointers.  DeepClone will not duplicate the frame map or class symbol for thenew object.  They will be shared with the original object. TotalClone(obj) - Makes and returns a "deep" copy of an object.  All of thedata referenced within the object is copied. Magic pointers are not followed.The object returned by TotalClone will be entirely contained in theNewtonScript heap. EnsureInternal(obj) - Ensures that the returned object exists entirely in theNewtonScript heap or the ROM.  This function may copy all, some, or none of theoriginal object.  Magic pointers are not followed. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^o  LAUGH--              --AT US, NOT WITH US       (X  X)                        Movies titles we'd like to see:      @@    @@                        "Backlight to the Future"        @@@@                        "Honey I Shrunk the MessagePad"                         "Terminator 2.0 or T2.0"                         "So I Married a Newton User!"                         "The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and Her MessagePad" Want your name in Tapped.In?

Over the past                        four months, Joey has been the choice of VARs and SIsinterested in developing Newton data collection solutions for these growingvertical markets:  public safety, sales automation, health care, manufacturing,inventory management, field service, insurance, athletics, and education. We congratulate Joey Technologies on the quality of its software developmentand its commitment to the Newton platform! ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^o  TOP PROJECT       IN THE FIELD WITH FIELDWORKER!   ***********        *     *      Toronto-based FieldWorker Products is the developer of        *     *      FieldWorker 2.0, a solution designed for location-linked        * * *        data collection using signals broadcast by satellites to a        *            Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver.  It allows        *            customers to create their own custom made applications                     without special purpose programming.  FieldWorker tries tomaximize the number of units sold by minimizing the number of constraints onwho can use it or on how it can be used. A variety of companies in a wide range of industries currently own FieldWorker2.0.  Because the solution shipped only six weeks ago, most of the 60 unitswhich have gone out are being used to develop trial projects.  Here are just afew of the markets in which FieldWorker 2.0 is being used. - Six units are being used in a field test for mineral exploration by oneof the world's largest mining companies.  Once development has been completed,FieldWorker will be used with MessagePads for global mining exploration. - Ten units are being used in two exploratory agribusiness applications forweed and fertilizer control over large geographic areas. - One unit is being used in a pilot project for an environmental studyaffiliated with a World Bank project in Africa.  If successful, it will becomea major tool for developing bank projects around the world. FieldWorker confines its customization efforts to projects which requirespecial enhancements for data collection or mapping interfaces.  One of thegoals at FieldWorker is to build relationships with other developers invertical markets to allow for on-the-spot processing of data that has beencollected for specialized vertical market purposes. If you would like more information on FieldWorker, contact Sandy Browne byfax:(416) 483-7069 or check out FieldWorker's website:http://www.fieldworker.com/fieldworker/. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^o     CALENDAR          MARK YOUR CALENDAR!!     |X X X X X|     |# # # # #|        o The Newton Systems Group will have a presence in     |# # # # #|        the following upcoming events:     |# # # # #| oo Inc.
