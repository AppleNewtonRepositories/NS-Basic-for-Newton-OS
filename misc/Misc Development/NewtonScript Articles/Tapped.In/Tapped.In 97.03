What is your role inside NSG, and what does your group do?A. I'm the manager of the Comm Software/Comm Solutions group. My group, asyou might guess, is responsible for writing and maintaining the corecommunications software shipped with the Newton -- both what goes intothe ROM (such as Appletalk, IRDA, Fax, and modem support) as well aspackages outside the ROM such as NIE. We recently combined with the CommSolutions group, so we now are also responsible for tracking issuesrelated to wireless and cellular communications, for helping licensingand other groups within NSG support special-purpose communicationshardware and software, and for maintaining the Comm Solutions web page.Q. Just what is the Comm Solutions web page?A. It provides a forum for answering questions developers and customershave concerning things like modem compatibility, special purposecommunications hardware, etc. For example, the page contains a list ofthe modems that we have tested and found compatible with differentversions of the Newton OS. Check it out at'http://devworld.apple.com/dev/newton/commsoln/comms.html'.Q. You said your group is responsible for NIE. Didn't you just ship anew version? What are its features?A. We just started shipping NIE 1.1 in January (it's available on theNewton web site). We call it the "secure" version of NIE because itincludes support for the access security options of PPP called PAP(Password Authentication Protocol) and CHAP (Challenge HostAuthentication Protocol) as well as support for Secure Card loginaccess. With the addition of PAP and CHAP we can now connect to justabout every ISP out there. And Secure Card is important because it is awidely-accepted method of safely gaining access to corporate intranetsthat are protected with firewall technology. For example, a customercould use NIE 1.1, a third-party internet application, and a Secure Card(such as SecurID from Security Dynamics) to dial into into theircompany's Secure Card-protected PPP server and access their internalemail account or browse the internal corporate intranet.Q. And what are your future plans for NIE?A. Well of course I can't give all the details away, but I can say thatthe next step for NIE is to support TCP/IP over Ethernet. We plan todeliver sometime in 1997 a framework that will allow NIE to run over avariety of wired- and wireless-Ethernet PCMCIA cards. We'll plan to  make aDDK available so hardware manufacturers can write drivers to enable theirPCMCIA Ethernet cards to run in the Newton OS and support NIE. This is acapability that quite a few customers and developers have requested, ashave people in the education market. We expect it to be a key factordifferentiating the eMate and MP2000 products in themarketplace and making them a big success.Q. Fascinating! Thanks for taking the time out to answer thesequestions.A. My pleasure. Thanks for asking.^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^*MARKETING FRONT*      CAROLYN DEBOER, SOLUTIONS MARKETING MANAGERQ: You're fairly new to the Newton Solutions Marketing team; tell usabout your role?A: Hi, yes, I am fairly new, starting just before the holidays inDecember. Newton is a really exciting technology and I wanted to be apart of a growing market segment. This is definitely the next technologywave. I joined the solutions marketing team to design and managemarketing programs for solution providers.Q: Which audiences are you targeting for marketing programs?A: Originally I was tasked with developing programs for VARs and SIs,but in defining the requirements of these solution providers, it wasobvious there were several similar requirements for ISVs and IHVs. Sonow in terms of program development, I regard everyone as a solutionprovider and look only at the core requirements and not necessarily atthe business profile or categorization.Q: What is your approach to program development?A: I like to get to know the target audience and really understand theirbusiness proposition. When possible I like to go to their locations andobserve the business environment. I then create a "laundry list" ofrequirements with as much detail as possible -- what program elements dothese solution providers need, why do they need this capability, andwhat process could be utilized to deliver this capability to this targetaudience. Then I look in the Apple arsenal and ask -- are there programsthat already exist that would meet the needs of this audience? There areterrific marketing programs already in place though Apple DeveloperWorld, Apple Solution Providers Network and the Education SolutionProviders program. The challenge is these marketing programs are moreMac OS centric and are not necessarily appropriate for all NewtonSolution Providers.I'm currently creating a map of solution provider requirements,deliverables against those requirements that already exist in otherorganizations that could be leveraged. I don't want to recreateperfectly effective programs that exist elsewhere in the corporation.Instead, I'd like to dedicate Newton resources to programs that willuniquely service our Newton Solution providers and create process roadmaps to the other marketing services and programs that exist and applyto Newton developers.I think the important thing is to source applicable existing marketingprograms, create the Newton-specific programs that need to be created,then wrap it all together in an easy to use process and a logical,comprehensive suite of offerings.Q: How can readers of Tapped-in contribute their ideas?A: I'm very interested to hear from more solution providers. They cansend solution marketing ideas to our e-mail address:Solutions@Newton.Apple.com^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^*VENDOR SPLENDOR*           K2 AND WYND REVIEWEDK2 CONSULTANTS^^^^^^^^^^^^^^K2 Consultants, based in Nashua, New Hampshire has been a leading Newtondeveloper in the medical and education markets. Founded in 1991, itoriginally provided UNIX network and server solutions to large corporatecustomers in the Boston area. While researching the needs for a clientin the mobile arena, K2's founder, Sandeep Shah, was invited toparticipate in a seed program for a new pen-based computer at Apple.K2's niche in "packaging of information" was defined when it releasedNewtRTFM, a reference tool for Newton developers.K2 was also invited to participate in a landmark research project atHarvard Medical School, Brigham and Women's Hospital, and MassachusettsGeneral Hospital. The Constellation Project was the first genuineresearch performed which validated the hypothesis that medicalprofessionals would use a PDA if provided with the proper applications.K2 played a key role in developing a complete suite of applications thatharnessed the power of the Newton platform.In 1994, after the publication of the results of Constellation, K2embarked on a mission to create what has now become the de factostandard for information technology on the Newton Platform, AdvancedReference Technology -ART(tm)- for Newton. The philosophy behind ART wasto create a means of accessing information as rapidly as possible andpresent it in a manner conducive to the MessagePad's form factor. Indeveloping ART, K2 used the modular approach of building small buteffective, inter-linked applications to support a wide variety ofapplications for information gathering and presentation.Since then, K2 has collaborated with various publishers and vendors torelease an array of medical products, representing state-of-the-art inthe Newton OS development. The advantage of ART interface and compatibilityincludes innovative yet consistent look-and-feel, enhanced compression,and application interlinking that dynamically exploits the features ofother ART compatible applications. Most applications also feature linksto a guideline navigator, a table explorer, and a formula solver.K2 ingenuity was put to the test during a major re-write of FractalMedical's Caduceus medical records product. K2 was later approached bythe First DataBank, a subsidiary of the Hearst Corporation to licenseART software and create a drug database, DrugPad.Most recently, K2 has released two new products in the medical arena,Ferri's The Practical Guide to the Medical Patient, with Mosby-YearBook, and MedScribe with 3SData Comm. These represent a combination oftechnological sophistication and medical know-how, making it the mostadvanced medical product on the market.With the forthcoming eMate, K2 is developing an ART versionof Webster's Dictionary and Thesaurus. This application will be availablefor the eMate 300 by the end of March.K2 Consultants is a Newton Systems Integrator and Developer. K2 has alsotaken a leading role in utilizing Internet as a means of distributingthe software. By using its sales partner 1st Stop software, K2 customershave been downloading the demos and applications for instant use.To get more information on K2 products or services, call (603) 551-5544or fax at (508) 842-3666.

WyndMail, when combined with theAllPoints Wireless PC Card from U.S. Robotics, turns the MessagePad into aneasy-to-use wireless communicator. WyndMail enables Newton users to easilysend and receive e-mail, send faxes, even send text-to-voice messages toany Internet address, fax machine or ordinary telephone--all without cords,cables, or phone lines."This is an exciting solution for Newton users," says Bob Kimball, ChiefTechnology Officer for Wynd Communications. "WyndMail gives MessagePadowners a simple, plug-and-play solution for sending and receivingwireless messages."WyndMail uses the Newton's universal in-box so messages appearautomatically, alerting the user with a simple chime. The chime can bechanged or turned off at the user's discretion.The AllPoints Wireless PC Card transfers data to and from the Newtonusing packet radio technology. This makes it impervious to the droppedcalls, interrupted transmissions, and roaming charges associated withcellular phones and modems. The messages are exchanged across the RAMMobile Data system, a network of radio towers that covers 93% of themetropolitan areas and airports in the U. S."WyndMail really expands the capabilities of the Newton and gives theuser a great deal of flexibility in communications," says Kimball. "Theability to send and receive messages in an airport shuttle, at arestaurant table, or during a meeting lets users maximize the use oftheir time."The latest version of WyndMail adds Message Header Preview (MHP) to thelist of the software's features. MHP gives MessagePad users even moreflexibility on the road, by allowing them to preview messages beforereceiving them wirelessly. Message headers are delivered for free, andthe user can choose to receive the complete message, forward themessage, delete the message, or hold the message for later delivery.This capability gives the user more control, and more choices on how andwhen they receive messages."WyndMail is very useful," says David Brady, a field support technicianfor MTV Networks and WyndMail user since August 1996. "With itstext-to-speech/pager functionality, it truly makes the Newton (MessagePad) a'message'pad."WyndMail 2.5 is available for the Newton MessagePad 120, 130 and 2000.For more information on WyndMail 2.5, contact Wynd at one of thelocations below.Phone: 800.549.9800 Phone: 805.781.6000 Fax: 805.781.6001 E-mail:info@wynd.com Web: http://www.wynd.com^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^*TECHIE TIP*Bob Ebert, DTS EngineerWe are in the final stages of releasing the Newton C++ Tools. Thesetools work on a Macintosh with Newton Toolkit 1.6.3 or later tointegrate C++ functions into your applications. This is not a generalpurpose C++ compiler for Newton; the tools are intended for veryspecific engineering tasks, and do not replace NTK.For most purposes, NewtonScript and NTK are appropriate and sufficientto create applications for the Newton platform. In some cases, you maywant to repurpose existing C++ code as an external routine for a Newtonapplication, or create new routines that are maximally optimized for theNewton platform. Be warned that existing code will almost certainlyrequire rework for the Newton OS, and Newton Tools for C++ have limitedaccess to the Newton OS APIs. In particular, the tools do not allowaccess to any user interface feature of the Newton OS.The tools are currently available as a developer release to members ofthe NewtonBeta seeding program. Participation in the NewtonBeta programis limited to members of the Newton Developer Program. For details onthe NewtonBeta program or the Newton Developer Program, write tonewtondev@newton.apple.com.^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^*HOORAY FOR HOLLYWOOD*     EMATE & BATGIRL COMING TO A THEATRE NEAR YOUA unique version of the Apple eMate 300 will appear in the upcomingWarner Bros. feature film, "Batman and Robin". This is the fourthinstallment of the popular "Batman" series and will star George Clooneyas "Batman", Chris O'donnell as "Robin" and Alicia Silverstone as"Batgirl". The character of "Batgirl" is a college student by day and"Batgirl" by night. She uses her eMate 300 as her main computer forcommunication in the film.^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^*TOP PROJECT*      PRODUCTION MAGIC PROVIDES MAGIC FOR "THIS OLD HOUSE"Viewers who tune into PBS and WGBH/Boston's popular weekly series "ThisOld House" won't recognize the role Production Magic's Shot Loggersystem plays in the show's production, but Ken Cowan, the show'sproduction assistant and editor Bill Howe strongly emphasizes itsimportance. "It's a great thing," Cowan reports. "And while it saves metime in the field, it saves Bill between four and six hours per show."Shot Logger for Newton is a wireless system for logging film and videofootage onto the Apple handheld computer. A transmitter attached to thecamera sends timecode to a wireless receiver pad housed in the MessagePad,allowing a script supervisor or production assistant to log timecode foreach take, compile detailed notes and define a list of preferred takesfor the editor. Once this information is recorded, it can be transferredto disk and formatted into a nonlinear editing environment. (The ShotLogger system is available to interface with systems from Avid, Media100, Scitex, Panasonic, Fast, Tektronix and D-Vision.) "The system makesour jobs so much more efficient," Cowan notes with a self-effacinglaugh. "I mean, as brilliant as I am, there's only so much I can domanually."Cowan explains that before the introduction of Shot Logger to theproduction team, he had "to record every take in this monstrous notebookins, outs, good takes, bad takes. Then, after every take, I'd have tocheck the timecode in the camera. After we wrapped for the day, I'dcreate a list for Bill based on this information."It was a pretty cumbersome process for me, but for Bill it was evenmore so," Cowan continues. He notes that using Shot Logger, Howe "onlyhas to click on two buttons to digitize the list into his Avid. When theProduction Magic people demonstrated the system, Bill said, "We needthis."Production Magic's Shot Logger for the Newton was developed by GreenMountain Software Corporation of Colchchester, Vermont. A new versionfor the MP2000 will be introduced at the National Association ofBroadcasters (NAB) Conference in Las Vegas April 7-10 in the AppleBooth.Ann Pettyjohn, Wizard Production Magic, Inc. 128 Prim Road   PO Box 700Colchester, Vermont 05446-0700 Tel: (802) 865-2728 Fax: (802) 865-2468Internet: Ann@ProductionMagic.com   Home Page:http://www.ProductionMagic.com^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^*CALENDAR         MARK YOUR CALENDAR!!|X X X X X||# # # # #|              * The Newton Systems Group will have a|# # # # #|                presence in the following upcoming events:|# # # # #|NMHCC                 April 14-17, 1997                    Washington DCThe NMHCC (National Managed Health Care Congress) is the largest managedcare conference in the United States, and as such the Newton Systemsgroup will be sponsoring a pavilion in conjunction with many of ourHealth Care solutions developers.
