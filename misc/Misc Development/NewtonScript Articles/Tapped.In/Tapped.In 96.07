VERNON HUANG, NEWTON MEDICAL SOLUTIONS     _________    | * * * * |         Q: What are the plans for Newton in Health Care?    | *     * |    | *     * |            The Newton Systems Group has identified health care    | * * * * |            as one of the top, perhaps the most important    |____@____|            vertical market to focus on with Newton.  We believe    |_________|            that Newton is uniquely positioned to provide a                           mobile solution addressing the needs of the healthcare provider.  Resources and manpower will be put into a devoted effort toestablish Newton as the standard for mobile computing in health care. In the short term, we have identified Home Health Care as the subsegment of theoverall health care picture that we will be placing significant efforts into.We're interested in all segments of the health care market of course. Q: What is your role in the Newton Systems Group? I'm primarily responsible for relations with developers working on health careapplications and evangelizing new developers both to work with Newton and todevelop health care applications. I try to keep up with all of the available applications for health care andeducate both customers and Newton marketing and sales folks about what isavailable. As we evangelize large health care organizations to work with Newtonit's to everyone's benefit that we introduce them to an existing Newtondeveloper. That way the development cycles are shorter, the customer doesn'thave to start from scratch and we reward those developers who have remainedloyal to our platform over the last three years. We publish a "Newton in Health Care Solutions Guide" which we send out free ofcharge to anyone who asks for it. Email me at huang@newton.apple.com if youhave a product that you would like included. Developers already featured don'tneed to do this as I'll be contacting them directly.^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^*   MARKETING FRONT     CAMI HSU, CONNECTIVITY PRODUCT MANAGER              XX             XX         Q: What is the Newton Connection Utilities (NCU) 1.0?            XX      XX   XX           A: NCU, which will be shipping this fall, allows the        XXX                user to integrate their Newton device with their                           existing Macintosh OS based computer or Windows PC.NCU provides direct synchronization between popular PC applications such asMicrosoft Schedule+, Now Up-to-Date and Contact, and Lotus Organizer with aNewton PDA.

QuickFigure Pro wasPelicanWare's first commercial product, with NewtCase, Notion, and AvailWorksadded to the PelicanWare line of products for the Newton platform. QuickFigure Pro 3.0, the latest version of the leading spreadsheet for NewtonPDA's, is designed to tightly integrate with the Newton 2.0 OS.  It uses Newton2.0's stationery feature to allow users to create spreadsheets in theMessagePad's built-in notepad, supports landscape orientation, and allows easyintegration with desktop spreadsheet applications.  Version 3.0 includes allthe features of previous versions including over 70 math, scientific,statistical, date, and financial functions, conditional operations, sorting,matrix solver, graphing and charting, "lookup" functions, templates, labellocking, and worksheet  password  protection. With QuickFigure's open, extensible architecture, system integrators and VARscan enhance QuickFigure directly or use QuickFigure to extend the functionalityof their own applications by adding QuickFigure Tools.  QuickFigure Tools areextensions to QuickFigure and are accessed through the Tools Button inQuickFigure.  One example of a tool created for QuickFigure is the GPS Tool,which imports position data from a Trimble ScoutMaster GPS. NewtCase 3.0, the Newton Ultimate Utility Suite, includes Newton 2.0 OS updatedversions of ICS's well-known Newton utilities and a new package that acts as analternative backdrop application to free up heap memory.  NewtCase utilitiesare designed to give the user more power and control over packages and memory.The NewtCase Utility Suite includes Package Manager, Extensions Manager,NewtInfo, SleepAid, GestureLaunch, Desktop, and SoupKitchen. Notion 1.5, the latest version of Notion: the High Performance List Manager,has been enhanced to take advantage of the Newton 2.0 OS and is faster andrequires fewer system resources than previous versions.  Version 1.5 includesall the features that made Notion the easy-to-use organizer: editable diamondlists, sorting, key word searching, and sticky notes.  New features includeintegration with dates and alarms, online help, and direct data exchange withdesktop applications through Notion Connect, a Notion Extra.  Notion Connectsupports import and export of tab-delimited text, a format read by most desktopdatabases and information managers. System integrators and VARs can extend Notion through custom list templates andan API for creating Notion Extras. AvailWorks 2.0: the 4-in-1 Business Productivity Tool, complements the existingPelicanWare product line by adding text and page layout capabilities.AvailWorks is an integrated tool for Newton-based devices that allows users towork with text, drawing tools, tables, and charts in a full-page, WYSIWYGenvironment. All PelicanWare products are aimed at providing the mobile professional withthe means to collect, organize, integrate, and communicate vital information onthe Newton platform.

FMS is dedicated toimproving the quality and delivery of medical care by enabling doctors to spendmore time taking care of patients and less time creating patient records.  Thekey to both programs is the use of the Newton to collect the information duringthe course of the patient visit, which is then downloaded to the desktop.  Datais collected using fully customizable pick lists or free text entry.  InCaduceusERG, an inexpensive solution for report generating, upon downloading,the report is automatically printed, and the data is destroyed.  In thecomprehensive program, Caduceus, the data is retained in a relational databaseand reports can be generated addressing virtually any issue.  Also,prescriptions and superbills can be printed or the system can be integratedwith existing prescription and billing systems.  The result is that thedoctor's record is created at the time of the visit, saving the doctor's time,reducing overhead and malpractice risk, and addressing managed care demands.You may contact Mark Granoff, MD, at granofm@bravado.net or access the orderpage on our website at http:\\www.factalmed.com or dial (310) 577-8338. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^*  TOP PROJECT          RIVER RUN'S MAIL ON THE RUN! A HIT WITH ONTARIO HYDRO   ***********        *     *         The Chemistry and Metallurgy Department of the Nuclear        *     *         Technology Group of Ontario Hydro does a lot of        * * *           traveling.  When they are on the road they need to        *               remotely stay in touch with colleagues and business        *               associates through the company email system.  They use                        Microsoft Mail on a Novell LAN network.  Ontario Hydrohave been searching for an inexpensive and lightweight solution, and they havefinally found it in River Run Software Group's Mail on the Run! product runningon an Apple MessagePad 130. In the spring, Carl Daniel of Ontario Hydro initiated a pilot test involvingthree users.  They used both telephone and circuit switched cellular networksto access their email from MessagePads.  Their network environment is a complexone and they uncovered requirements that River Run Software needed to resolvesuch as multiple post offices on a single LAN and the ability to exchange mailwith users through the Internet gateway.  With these requirements beingaddressed in the new release of the product, management was impressed and gavethe approval to form an implementation team to expand the usage of Newtons andMail on the Run! throughout the department. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^*     CALENDAR          MARK YOUR CALENDAR!!     |X X X X X|     |# # # # #|        * The Newton Systems Group will have a presence in     |# # # # #|        the following upcoming events:     |# # # # #| MacWorld Boston '96                                        August 7-10Newton will have a large presence within the Apple booth at the MacWorld BostonShow.
