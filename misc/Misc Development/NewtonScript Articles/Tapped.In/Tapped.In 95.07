Our main    |_________|          functions are to find problems—not just bugs but also                         design flaws that might interfere with the user ordeveloper experience—and to ensure product stability.  We balance these qualityneeds with time-to-market pressures to make sure we get quality products intoour customers’ hands as soon as possible. One of the key philosophies of Newton SQA is that our job is not done when theproduct ships. Instead, we use the experience we've gained to help us makebetter decisions for future revisions—and for the Newton platform.  Forexample, when we plan our API testing, we talk to Developer Technical Supportto determine the most used, as well as the most complained-about APIs.Moreover, for one to two months after a product ships, we communicate at leastonce a week with Customer Support to see if there are any problems we missed,or to let them know how to tell customers to work around known problems. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^•   MARKETING FRONT   SHERI ARAPOV, NSG EVENT MARKETING AND PROGRAM MANAGER              XX             XX         Q:  What is your role in the Newton Systems Group?            XX      XX   XX           A:  I coordinate tradeshow events for the Newton Group,        XXX                 oversee Apple's Newton direct marketing efforts and                            manage Apple's Newton detailing program. As Apple's Newton Event Marketing Manager, I work in conjunction with Apple'scorporate event marketing team as the Newton champion to promote the AppleMessagePad at corporate trade shows and events.  There are five corporateevents in which Apple participates: MacWorld San Francisco, MacWorld Boston, PCExpo, and Fall & Spring Comdex. In addition to participating in Apple sponsored events, the Newton Group isalso active in vertically-focused events, specifically in the areas of healthcare, sales force automation and data capture.  These particular venues areideal for demonstrating appropriate Newton solutions to a targeted audiencewith very specific needs. I work with regional Apple offices to obtain a MessagePad presence at regionalevents. I also support developers by providing them with marketing materialsfor shows, such as banners, MessagePad datasheets or Apple logo backdrops whichare used in smaller shows. Currently, the Newton Group participates in 13 trade shows per year andsupports approximately 8 regional shows per quarter with aggressive tradeshowplans for '96.  Our goal at trade shows is to generate demand and increaseawareness & education around the Newton platform. To those of you who haveparticipated with the Newton Group in past events or demonstrated yoursolutions independently of the Newton Group, thank you for your support and forhelping to spread the Newton message! ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^•  VENDOR SPLENDOR      PHYSIX SOFTWARE AND LANDWARE, INC. REVIEWED    VV       VV     VV     VV          Physix Software      VV   VV           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^       VV VV            One of the leading areas in Newton software development        VVV             recently has been in the health care field.

Do you need a good MessagePad Presentation to open a         !!!            meeting with?  In your last Quarterly Pouch, we         !!!            shipped three presentations (both hard copy and on the         !!!            CD) to fit your needs.  We provided hard copies so                        that you can conveniently and quickly make         !!!            overheads. Following is a description of the three presentations: 1)  NEWTON SOLUTIONS:  The objective of this presentation is to provide theaudience with an OVERVIEW OF APPLE NEWTON MESSAGEPAD SOLUTIONS -- bothindividual productivity products and enterprise solutions. 2) NEWTON FORMS SOLUTIONS:  The purpose of this presentation is to give theaudience a brief overview of Apple MessagePad's capabilities as a MOBILEELECTRONICS FORMS PLATFORM, and discuss KEY THIRD PARTY FORMS APPLICATIONS thatare available today. 3) NEWTON COMMUNICATIONS SOLUTIONS, AND WIRELESS TECHNOLOGY:  This presentationcovers the WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS STRATEGY for the Newton platform, anddiscusses communications alternatives such as Paging, Cellular, GSM, 2-Waywireless packet and Wireless LAN. If you did not receive this and would like a hard copy, please send yourrequest to Tapped.In. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^•  TECHIE TIPS          PCMCIA SERIAL CARDS AND THE NEWTON       ?? ??     ??     ??          You can use PCMCIA Serial Cards on Newton devices as                        long as you pretend that they are modems.  The modem           ??           comm tool knows how to talk to PCMCIA devices, but it         ??             expects to be able to send "AT" commands to the                        modem. By telling the modem tool to go into "Passthru"         ??             mode, you can avoid sending these AT commands and use                        the card normally. The key is to set up "ModemPrefs" and "ModemProfile" options in theconfigOptions of your endpoint. The ModemPrefs option tells the modem tool togo into passthru mode, and the ModemProfile option prevents the Modem Enablerfrom messing things up. After connecting you need to set any serial parameters,like baud rates, that are needed. This has to be done after connecting becausethe modem tool still thinks it's dealing with a modem, so it sets up the serialport accordingly. If you want a different setup you need to set that after themodem tool is done with it. The latest Communications Q&A has all the detailson how to do this.  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^•  LAUGH--              --AT US, NOT WITH US       (X  X)                        Customer Service Humor      @@    @@          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^        @@@@            The following Call-of-the-Day was submitted by Lynn                        Strohmeyer of the Newton Support Group in Sterling, CO. Lynn: "How may I help you sir?" Caller: "Well, a few minutes ago I spilled coffee on my Newton and I shook offmost of the moisture and I still had some liquid under the display." Lynn: "Okay, so is the unit operating properly now?

Director    *******  *           Geoff Murphy, a PowerBook user for years, embraced       *                 Apple's Newton technology and design to play a crucial      * *                role in moving along the film's plot. He was eager and     *   *               open to working closely with the Newton team to make                         the film's MessagePad sequences as true-to-life as                         possible. Mike Culbert of Newton Hardware and a member of the original Newton developmentteam, played an integral part in the MessagePad's first major full-lengthappearance.  He scripted a Newton software sequence to match the one writtenfor the film. In this scene Casey Ryback (Steven Seagal) faxes an SOS messageto intelligence headquarters alerting them that he is onboard a train hijackedby terrorists and in need of help. A combination of Geoff Murphy's extremeinterest in supporting the Newton platform in the film and Apple's flexibilityand hard work in making it happen, results in a film of high magnitude whereNewton saves the day! ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^•  PREMIER INTEGRATOR   CONGRATULATIONS WAYFARER COMMUNICATIONS!         **             Wayfarer Communications is a developer of client/server        ****            software which integrates mobile computers into     ***********        enterprise networks.
