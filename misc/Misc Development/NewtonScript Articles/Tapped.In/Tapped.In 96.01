We have    |____@____|          responsibility for the AC adapters, batteries and the    |_________|          internal DC-DC converters that convert battery voltage                         into several internal voltages for use by core logicand external devices such as the PCMCIA slot and Serial port.  We also dobattery testing and user models for simulating battery life using thesedifferent models. Q: What projects are your group currently working on? A: We have had many requests from end users and vertical integrators forbacklighting.  To that end we've spent some time looking into various techniquetradeoffs involving the backlight itself, as well as power requirements,battery life impacts, cost and size issues.  We think we've solved many of theconcerns about life/brightness/size and cost issues and will probablyincorporate them into future products. Q: What about the battery area?  There's been a lot of talk recently aboutNickel Metal, Lithium Ion and the new Ray-O-Vac Renewal cells. A: We are continuing to talk with vendors of all these technologies and arerunning tests on each of them to find the best price/performance for customers.You will probably see us move from the Ni-Cd technology, which is mature andlow cost, to Nickel Metal Hydride in future models as the price/performancetradeoff improves.  Lithium Ion is still too far out for the MessagePad.  Thecost of the cells alone is still about 6-8 times that of the Ni-Cd and theexpense of adding the very specific charging and safety mechanisms inside theproduct is very high compared to the MessagePad's cost. The Renewal cells(rechargeable alkaline) have been tested, but we have no strong opinion one wayor the other.  Although some users have had good experiences with the Renewals,we probably will not OEM them to customers directly.  Currently we offer theNewton Ni-Cd pack for customers who prefer a rechargeable solution. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^o   MARKETING FRONT   DAVID GLICKMAN, PRODUCT MKTG MGR, PC CONNECTIVITY PROD.              XX             XX       Q: What is your role as Marketing Manager for PC                         connectivity products?            XX      XX   XX         A: When discussing the Newton 2.0 platform with our        XXX              partners and customers, the Newton Systems Group                         divides the customer usage areas of the Newton 2.0platform into three sectors: Organization, Communication, and Integration.It is the area of PC integration where I focus the vast majority of my timeas Platform Marketing Manager. I am the Product Manager for our suite of desktop connectivity products,including Newton Backup Utility (NBU), Newton Press, and Newton PackageInstaller - all of which are developed for both Macintosh and Windowsplatforms.  In this capacity, I work with our engineering teams to developproducts based on developer and customer feedback.  Our goals with theseproducts are to provide simple to use, inexpensive (or free) solutions forevery user's connectivity needs. With Newton Backup Utility, we realized a need to provide a free solution whichwould allow customers to backup and restore their Newton PDA information.  Tothis end, we provide NBU in every MessagePad 120 box along with the necessaryMacintosh and PC cables.  In addition, NBU is available on-line on our web siteat http://www.info.apple.com/newton. A product many of you have probably heard about, and hopefully have used, isNewton Press - a simple, easy to use desktop application for creating anddownloading Newton Books.  With Newton Press, a user simply drags wordprocessing files, text files, and pictures onto the Newton Press icon toquickly and easily create Newton Books.  In addition, Newton Press gives usersthe power to edit and format books, create table of contents entries, and evencreate simple links between paragraphs within a book. The reception to Newton Press has been overwhelming, with a growing library ofNewton Books available on the WWW and major on-line services.  Due to thetremendous interest in Newton Press we have posted a fully functionalpre-release version of Newton Press for Macintosh on the WWW(http://www.info.apple.com/newton) for users until February 15, 1995.  Thefinal version of Newton Press for Macintosh will ship in February at an SRP of$69.95.  Windows users can expect a fully functional pre-release version ofNewton Press for Windows available on-line in the coming months. While Apple's PC integration products are an important part of ourconnectivity strategy for Newton 2.0, a more important factor is the growingnumber of third party integration solutions for Newton 2.0.  Ranging from PIMapplications with direct synchronization to Newton PDAs to database programswith direct links to Newton PDAs, it is the growth of third party integrationapplications that will continue to set the Newton 2.0 platform apart from otherPDA platforms on the market. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^o VENDOR SPLENDOR       CLARIS AND ELEAY REVIEWED    VV       VV     VV     VV          CLARIS      VV   VV           ^^^^^^       VV VV            Claris Corporation of Santa Clara, CA has announced        VVV             FileMaker Pro 3.0 Companion for the Apple MessagePad                        120 with Newton 2.0, bringing one of the firstmainstream desktop software applications directly to the MessagePad.  Thesoftware package for Newton 2.0 will be supported by FileMaker Pro 3.0 forMacintosh, the next version of the world's most popular Macintosh database. Delivering true Newton-to-desktop data management, FileMaker Pro 3.0 Companionfor Newton allows users to capture subsets or collections of FileMaker Pro 3.0desktop-based records and fields on the Apple MessagePad 120 for updatinganywhere.  Later, new or modified records can be returned to the original hostFileMaker database for synchronization to insure database integrity. Users of FileMaker Pro 3.0 Companion for Newton will enjoy much of the samefunctionality found within FileMaker Pro 3.0.  Specific features provided byFileMaker Pro 3.0 Companion for Newton include the following: FileMaker Pro interface and functions:  Provides the ability to browse, sort,query and print downloaded data as well as perform look-ups from otherFileMaker Pro 3.0 Companion databases that may also reside on the AppleMessagePad 120.  Other typical functions such as auto entry, pop-up lists,check boxes and radio lists will be available in FileMaker Pro 3.0 Companionfor Newton. Desktop Connectivity and Database Creation:  Provides live connection todesktop and network-based (Macintosh and Windows) FileMaker Pro databases andthe ability to download subsets, or collections, of these database records tothe Apple Message Pad 120.  In addition, Apple MessagePad 120 users candownload simple FileMaker Pro layouts without records to create new databasesdirectly on the Apple MessagePad 120. Synchronization:  Direct record-level synchronization from FileMaker Pro 3.0Companion to desktop-based FileMaker Pro 3.0 databases. Communications:  The new product completely supports all basic communicationsfunctionality provided by the Apple MessagePad 120 with Newton 2.0 (beaming,faxing and mailing). Password Protection:  FileMaker Pro 3.0 Companion for Newton will provide thesame database security provided by FileMaker Pro 3.0 for Macintosh and Windows. FileMaker Pro Companion for Apple MessagePad 120 with Newton 2.0  will bedisk-based and will require FileMaker Pro 3.0 for Macintosh. The software isdesigned to operate with the Apple MessagePad 120 with Newton 2.0 and anyMacintosh or Power Macintosh (standalone or networked via AppleTalk, IPX/SPX orTCP/IP) but not with standalone versions of FileMaker Pro 3.0 for Windowsrunning on PCs with Windows 95. For more information on other Claris products, contact Claris at 800/3-CLARISor 408/727-8227 or visit ClarisWeb, the Claris Internet home page athttp://www.claris.com. ELEAY INC.^^^^^^^^^^EleAy, Inc. is an advertising agency specializing in software marketing for theNewton, Macintosh and Windows platforms.

Bruce Thompson - Newton DTS Engineer     ??     ??           ??           If you're writing apps that use any form of         ??             Communications and you're looking for a good reason to                        switch over to Newton 2.0, here it is: Comms is a whole         ??             new world in 2.0.  The entire communications                        architecture has been redone.  The Communicationsvolume of the new Newton Programmer's Guide contains all the detailedinformation you need, but I'll give you a taste here. In the 1.X world, Communications apps were forced to perform some actionssynchronously (e.g., Connect) and some asynchronously (e.g., Abort).  In thecase of Abort, there was no way of knowing whether or not the Abort had beencompleted, which resulted in the need for delayed/deferred actions.  Now in2.0, any operation (with the exception of Instantiate and Dispose) can be doneasynchronously.  A script can also be provided that will be called when theaction is completed.  This allows an application to perform all actionsasynchronously and ensures that a new action doesn't start before the previousone has finished. Finally, the handling of various data types has been cleaned up considerably.Input and Output can now be done directly on strings, binary objects (includingVBOs), integers, `C? structures and frames.  The OutputFrame call from 1.X isnow a thing of the past.  Output accepts an additional argument which is usedto specify the kind of data to output. These are just a couple of the highlights of the new Communicationsarchitecture for 2.0.  The new endpoint (protoBasicEndpoint) should makewriting communications apps more straightforward. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^o  LAUGH--              --AT US, NOT WITH US       (X  X)                        The following Call-of-the-Day was submitted by Apple      @@    @@          Assistance Center agent Barb Kelley in Sterling,                        Colorado:        @@@@                        A customer called because she had received a message onher Apple MessagePad screen that her MessagePad was broken.

Since     ***********        then the company has developed into an international       *** ***          organization with a staff of 2,100 based in 20      ***   ***         countries in Western Europe, North America, Asia                        Pacific and Eastern Europe.  PA Consulting undertakesprojects in all parts of the world, drawing upon staff located in some 44offices, two technology laboratories and a management training center. The mobile business solutions developed by PA are often a part of much largerprojects involving a wide range of management and technology consulting skills.For example, the Newton-based workplace assessment system featured in Tapped.InDecember was part of a $20M training process re-engineering assignment forBritish Rail.  Another project involving Astra Research had its origins in workaimed at bringing pharmaceutical products to market more quickly. While the Mobile Business Solutions team works with a range of PDAs and otherportable devices, the majority of PA's projects are focused on the Newton asthe most cost effective solution.  PA Consulting's international base enablesthem to address clients world-wide. We congratulate PA Consulting on the quality of its systems integrationsoftware development and its commitment to the Newton platform! ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^o  TOP PROJECT       MEASURING UP WITH LEICA!   ***********        *     *      Leica Inc., the Atlanta-based North American headquarters        *     *      of Leica AG (Switzerland), will be providing an even more        * * *        powerful solution for professionals who perform detailed        *            measurements and calculations as part of their work.        *            Leica has teamed up with Green Mountain Software                     Corporation of Colchester, VT to build applications thatlink the DISTO, Leica's award-winning handheld electronic measuring device andthe Apple MessagePad.  The first offering for the MessagePad is DISTOPad, whichallows users to record, annotate, print and store measurements on a "per job"basis, as well as perform area and volume calculations. The DISTO itself solves a very basic problem for professionals: it allows anindividual to obtain precise long distance measurements single-handedly.  Theremainder of the problem is solved by teaming the DISTO with the MessagePad andDISTOPad: it allows an individual to accurately record, log and performcalculations on those same measurements out in the field and upload thatinformation to a desktop computer.  The result is a significant improvement inaccuracy and productivity along with a significant savings in time. The system is being introduced throughout Leica's North American distribution,particularly to those dealers specializing in construction instruments andproducts for the architectural, engineering, construction, surveying, andallied fields. Leica will be bundling DistoPad free with each Data DISTO sold.  A desktop PCupload utility will be sold as an option to users of the basic package. Partiesinterested in key vertical market applications should contact Leica directly. For more information on DISTO and DISTOPad contact Leica at (800) 367-9453. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^o     CALENDAR          MARK YOUR CALENDAR!!     |X X X X X|     |# # # # #|        o The Newton Systems Group will have a presence in     |# # # # #|        the following upcoming events:     |# # # # #| o Lotusphere Conference                        Jan. 22-24    Orlando, FL^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Lotusphere attracts over 7,000 IS managers, business partners and consultantsat this annual event.
