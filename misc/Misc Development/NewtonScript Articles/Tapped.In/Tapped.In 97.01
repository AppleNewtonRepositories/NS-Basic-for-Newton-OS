We find the companies that fulfill ProductMarketing's vision for the product bundles as well as introduce new andinnovative products developed by third party companies to Co-Marketingso that they can get them involved in press releases, solutionsmarketing guides, apple web sites and upcoming events.TI:  And what are "emerging technologies"?Don: Internet stuff mostly, as well as e-mail, wireless technologies,voice, and modems.  There are some very new ideas coming out as wellthat we are just now looking at.TI:  What is your background Don?I have sort of a two tiered background - my business degree is from theUniversity of Washington in Seattle where I began a career in financewith Boeing Aerospace.  After five years there I decided to go intosales and marketing taking positions in Major Accounts with GRiD Systemsand AST Research.  I moved into corporate marketing with Multidata Corp.and was Director of Vertical Market Solutions for Socket Communicationsjust before coming on board with Apple.The second tier of my background is in philosophy, history andreligiousstudies where I have a masters degree and doctorate. I enjoyresearch and writing very much and I am currently working on a new book.TI: What do you like best about your job at Apple?Don: I love the technology, but I would have to say I like the peoplethe best.  People here at Apple are great and so are the developers wepartner with.  It is very rewarding to be around such knowledgeable,hardworking and honest people.  The computer business can be dog eat dog- especially in the Valley - but at Apple, you deal with people who seemto really care about you as a person and they want you to be successful. The environment here is creative and people work as equals - but thereis a definite mission that everyone is working hard to reach.  The otherthing I guess is the challenge.  I like to think of myself as a rebeland I absolutely love the underdog.  I'd like to be one of the peoplethat can say one day "I helped to make Apple great again". That wouldmean a lot.^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^*MARKETING FRONT*   DAVE RUSSELL, MANAGER OF PRODUCT MARKETING, NSGQ.  What is Apple's software bundling strategy for Newton computers andhow does this fit with the "Whole Product Solution" concept we keephearing about?A.  Two things.  First, many Newton products--including MessagePadsandeMate 300's--must deliver distinct customer value right out of thebox. They must offer superior integration and be fully useful withoutrequiring accessories or add-ons to be purchased immediately afterward.This is especially true for products with broad-based appeal.  Forexample, the MessagePad 130 and the upcoming MessagePad 2000 aredesigned for mobile professionals and broadly distributed in retailstores.  Further, the eMate 300 should dramatically enhance a school'sability to provide essential computing resources to even more children.We strive to provide these customers with an Apple-labeled Whole ProductSolution; a bundle of Apple hardware and software, with third-partysoftware or peripherals included in the system.Second,we look to our ISV and peripherals allies to deliver many, manysolutions to the general Newton marketplace in the greater sense of theterm "Whole Product Solution."  For example, these products can becomplementary to the software bundled with Newton products, or theymight offer more desirable features, in which case the customer willmake a secondary purchase to gain increased functionality.I should also mention that some Newton devices will be offered with areduced bundle for vertical markets and Value-added resellers.Q. Are there opportunities for third party products to be offered aspart of a bundle with Newton devices?A.  Absolutely. I encourage all developers to enhance the core Newtonproduct, and round out the Whole Product Solution.  Apple's bundlingstrategy in horizontal markets allows us to reevaluate the softwarebundled on Newton systems as new products are introduced, and when werevise or modernize existing hardware offerings.Q.  So what specific opportunities should developers look forward to?A.  Tremendous opportunities!  The New Year is looking like "The Year ofNewton."  Our goal is to rapidly increase the installed base ofsatisfied Newton users.  This is essential for our continued mutualsuccess.  Apple is expanding its Newton-based hardware offerings withthe MessagePad 2000 and eMate 300 to enter new markets. The combinationof the eMate 300 and Apple's uniquely strong position in educationprovides Newton developers with a completely new environment to developsolutions for, and should signal development of software for curriculumdevelopment, classroom delivery, and learning.  The MessagePad 2000'shalf-VGA, 16-grayscale screen, its higher performance architecture andenhanced I/O, and inclusion of email and internet browser software opensup even more opportunities.Q.  Thanks for your comments.  Anything else to add?A.  Just this; Expanding our market share is essential to our mutualsuccess.  Apple recognizes that Newton must have the strong support ofthe developer community.  We look forward to participating with you in ahighly successful 1997!^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^* VENDOR SPLENDOR*    REVELAR AND TRUE NORTH REVIEWEDREVELAR^^^^^^^^^Revelar Software is pleased to announce the release ofRCU 2.2, completely savvy with NOS 2.0. It gives users a live or virtualconnection between their Newton PDA and their desktop computer. This newversion brings enhanced features and more speed to this widely usedapplication. RCU continues its reputation of providing extremely usefuland intuitive features by allowing users to browse, add, delete, modify,import, and export Newton data in real time from the desktop PC.Graphics are fully supported and can be imported/exported and convertedinto PICT or BMP files on the computer and visa-versa.The built-in Newton applications of Names, NotePad, Date Book, and To Dolist are still supported, but now, with the release of RCU 2.2, 3rdparty Newton applications can be easily supported and accessed with the"live" connection if a simple "ADF" (Application Definition Format file)is written by the developer. Now any Newton application's informationcan be exchanged with the desktop. Revelar is offering all 3rd partydevelopers the chance to develop an ADF and send it to us to be postedon our web site. License rights are available to developers who wish tooffer RCU bundles with their own software. Contact Robyn Buckwalter atrobyn@revelar.com for more information.A recent review in Pen Computing called RCU, "indispensable" andconcludes, "The bottom line is that I found all of these features to beentirely flawless and very useful indeed."RCU is compatible with the MessagePad 2000 and eMate 300.Revelar can be reached at (800) 669-5191 or (801) 485-3291, fax (801)485-3296. You can also send Email to info@revelar.com or visit their website at http://www.revelar.comRCU and other software products can be downloaded, demo-ed, andpurchased online and by email.Revelar Software 2350 E.

Out ofPocket's purpose is the rapid production of business expense reports,while satisfying two of True North's design goals.First, it satisfies the needs of True North's customers, who wanted apowerful, flexible business tool. Expense slips can be fully customizedfor each type of expense, with most slip fields fully automated. Ratherthan use the traditional, limited method of creating a report andaddingexpenses to it, Out of Pocket lets users add expenses first andthen define reports later to collect and prepare printed reports. Forexample, you can prepare weekly, monthly, travel, and client expensereports from a common set of expenses. And although Out of Pocketprovides connection software to export expenses to the desktop in QIF ortab-delimited format, the application focuses on the production of highquality expense reports printed directly from the MessagePad. Since TrueNorth's surveys and market research indicated that customers didn't wantto spend as much time connecting, exporting, importing and formattingtheir expenses as it took them to fill out a report by hand, Out ofPocket ships with 15 report formats that do all the work with a tap ofthe pen.Out of Pocket's second goal is to serve as the keystone for a suite ofcustom solutions for any company that chooses to arm its mobileprofessionals with Newton technology. True North has provided customexpense reports to such companies as Apple Computer, CBS/Westinghouse,BFGoodrich and the National Audubon Society. Once a company realizesthat its employees can use the MessagePad and Out of Pocket to print itsown expense reports, it is usually quick to request additional customsoftware. True North wants a prospective client to see her company'sexpense report printed from the MessagePad and say "That's what I do fora living!" rather than "How do I use this hardware in my job?"Out of Pocket 1.5 is currently available from True North and itsresellers and fully supports the MessagePad 2000. True North is activelyseeking alliances with Newton integrators who need a solution to helpclose their development deals with corporate customers. True North canbe reached by phone at (603) 472-7888, by fax at (603) 472-7887, or byemail at info@northisup.com.

What does that mean fordevelopers? The main thing is that you can now connect to ISPs that usePAP or CHAP authentication. Since most ISPs are moving in thisdirection, connecting with NIE is becoming easier and easier. Anothernew feature for NIE development is the inclusion of a global functionthat will translate NIE related error numbers into meaningful strings.So when a problem occurs you don't have to put up a cryptic message like"An error occurred: -60061", instead you can have an error message thatactually means something to your users.^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^*TOP PROJECT*   TACTILE PROVIDES SOLUTIONS FOR THE SINGAPORE GOVERNMENTSince November 1996, the Construction Industry Development Board (CIDB)has been piloting a Newton based building inspection tool developed ascooperative project between BYTE SYSTEMS, a 4D Developer and systemsintegrator and Tactile Systems, Inc. for Fullmark Data.The CIDB has been given the authority by the Singapore government toevaluate the quality and performance of the contractors working on newconstruction in Singapore. Their interest in Newton Technology startedin the beginning of 1996 after a preliminary demonstration by Fullmarkand review sessions with the board of management. EC Tan, President ofBYTE SYSTEMS commented on the experience by stating; "Performing theproject development overseas and managing it in Singapore is both achallenge and experience on both parties. Tactile Systems Inc has madegood efforts in ensuring that the work requirements are deliveredpromptly and trouble free. Tactile Systems Inc was in fact the firstcompany who had responded to us favorably."As an alternative to paper based inspection methods CONQUAS software,developed by Tactile Systems, goes fully digital. New inspectionprojects are entered into a 4D database. The database organizes theinspection dispatching each morning. Inspectors connect to the databaseusing serial or LocalTalk and receive a list of projects they will needto visit the next day.Once on the site, the inspectors are required to follow the strictgovernment guidelines for inspections set out by the Singaporegovernment. The Newton software design makes sure these guidelines arefulfilled, ensuring accurate inspections every time.A) Limit testing on the data helps to prevent against typos. B) Pulldown lists limit the standardized fields to their required list ofresponses. C) Free form comments area provides the Inspectors with aplace to handle unusual reports. D) Built in access to the standardsdocumentation provides a quick and handy reference tool.The software also helps the inspectors understand their workload,listing the numbers of visual samples required for each step of theinspection.  A digital notepad gives them a place to draw room sketchesand notations.Upon their return to the main office, the data is transferred back tothe 4D system electronically, reducing data entry time. The digitalsketches are converted to PICT files and are included as part of theinspection record.CONQUAS software runs on Newton 2.0 based hardware and connects to a4thDimension database developed by BYTE SYSTEMS. Tactile integrates thetwo applications with a separate DIL based communications package theydeveloped called TSServer.The MacOS 4D database system features include the capabilities to importscores collected from the Newtons on-site, consolidate scores andcalculate points to be awarded to the contractors/developer of theproject. Up to date results/scores can then be printed and faxed uponrequest. Final ratings achieved upon completion of the project will thenbe awarded to the respective companies that have attained the higheststandard in building quality.Tactile Systems can be found on the web at http://www.rmi.net/~rbruce/or 303 841 1114.
