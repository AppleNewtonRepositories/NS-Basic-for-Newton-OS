Isn't that a rather hackneyed, tired oldway of doing an interview?Robin:  That's OneT:      Ok, ok... Then would you please introduce yourself?R:      Hi. I'm Robin Goldstein. I'm engineering manager for theNewton Connection Engineering Team.T:      Hmmm.... We've heard rumors about you... Something abouthaving been a lawyer?R:      There are lots of rumors about me. The safest thing to dois assume they're all true. (Except for the one about the schnauzer... Theywere never able to prove a thing... Lucky for me, Poloroids don't havenegatives.)T:      Fine, then... Let's get back to the interview. What aresome of the responsibilities of the Connection Engineering Team?R:      Our team is responsible for developing the desktop applications andtools which make it possible to communicate with the Connect/Dockapplication in the Newton OS. Currently we are working on a number ofprojects. Rob Langhorne is our engineering lead for our DIL's developmentefforts. Paul Rekieta is our engineering lead on our eMate classroom serverproject. And Lucien Dupont is our engineering lead on the Newton ConnectionUtilities (NCU) project.T:      Speaking of NCU, what is the current status?R:      It's late.T:      Are you giving short answers just to use up the twenty questionsmore quickly?R:      Yes.T:      Ok. You got us with that one. But seriously, what is the currentstatus of NCU? And when can we expect to see a release? And are we going tohave to go through this all over again when you have to develop the nextversion of NCU to support the eMate 300 and MessagePad 2000?R: That counts as three questions. But let me address them all. First, thecurrent status of NCU is that it's in active development. Contrary to whatyou may have heard, we have not abandoned NCU, either for the Mac or forWindows. We have a great, dedicated team of development and qualityassurance engineers being led by a new engineering program manager. We'vegot some new talent on board, some seasoned talent who have stepped forwardto make sure NCU is a robust piece of software, and the full and activebacking of NSG management to make sure that NCU is well, done right anddone now.Second, regarding when the program will be released, right now there arepublic beta releases of both the Mac and Windows versions of the program,and we're encouraging people to download the software, use it, and reportany bugs they find. If you're on the WWW, you can find the NCU web page athttp://www.newton.apple.com/newton/solutions/ncu.htmlIt is the team's plan to update these public releases often. There may evenbe a new release by the time this issue of TI is distributed. And feedbackcan be sent electronically by following the instructions on the NCU webpage.Finally, regarding support in NCU for our newest products, here's theinside scoop. The development of NCU has been moving along, slower thananyone would have liked, but at a steady forward pace. It was planned tohave NCU available as a finished product in the November time frame forboth Mac and Windows, and to then begin development of the extensionsneeded to support the eMate and MP2000 products. Unfortunately, thingsdon't always go as planned. As the old song goes, "Some days you're thewindshield and Some days you're the bug." And so a decision had to be made.The resources, people, and equipment being used to finish development andtesting of NCU were the same resources assigned to develop the next versionof NCU. NCU is the foundation upon which the next version of NCU is based.Moving NCU out the door before it was really finished meant that unresolvedissues would be simply deferred to the next version. Continuing work on NCUuntil complete further delayed the beginning of development on NCU.Therefore a decision was made to combine the development efforts needed tofinish the original NCU code and to add the new requirements necessary tosupport our new products. The practical result is that it will take longerto go GM on the original NCU work, but when finished it will be of thequality required, providing a stable base for further refinements. Fromcurrent MP 120/130 users perspective, NCU is not going to be available in ashrink-wrapped box in November, but it will continue to be available as aseries of on-going beta releases on our WWW site until GM. For eMate andMP2000 users, Newton Connection Utilities will be shipped, in the box, withtheir hardware. No If's, And's or But's. Mac and Windows. The ConnectionEngineering team, as well as NSG management, knows all too well the valueof shipping a mobil handheld computer without a solid, intelligent,connection solution. As Apple PR is fond of saying, "Been There, DoneThat". So when you purchase your MP2000, NCU will be in the box, ready togo.T:     You're longwinded... The rumors about having been a lawyer must be true!R:      And, I was told by the editor of Tapped.In that I'd be paid by the word!T:      Wait a second!!! We never said any such thing!R:      Hmmm... Sounds like you should change the name to "Tapped.Out".T:      Ok, let's get back to the other projects. What's the future ofDIL's? What's the eMate server?R:      Well, basically the future of DIL's is bright. We're looking for anupcoming release of our CDIL's and FDIL's, and a first release of ourPDIL's. In addition, we've got some interesting work being done whichshould be of interest to developers who like to work with Visual Basic.DIL's are an important part of our connectivity future, and our plan is tostrengthen our DIL's offerings, providing greater functionality and moresupport. The eMate server we've mentioned takes full advantage of our DIL'stechnology and is a model for our planned development of futureconnectivity products and technologies. The eMate server permits multipleclassroom eMate users to connect to a server in an education environment.Very cool!T:      What about the future? What about dial-in? What about TCP/IPconnectivity? What about IRDA connectivity?R:      Jackpot! That brings us to seventeen. The future is bright. We'relooking at all of the technologies mentioned and will prioritize thosewhich the marketplace tells us are the most important. Some technologiesare close, but slipped off our plate because we were up to speed on Mac butnot Windows. This is no longer an acceptable model for connectivity.Connection Engineering is the doorway between the Newton OS and thedesktop. We need to support all our users, regardless of what's "inside".On the Mac side we're strong. On the Windows side we are still ramping up.If someone is interested in being a part of our team, they should drop me aline (robin@newton.apple.com) and attach a copy of their resume.T:      Ok... We're almost out of time... Last three questions...First, what's your favorite color?R:  Newton Green (you've seen it...it's that black plastic color we use onall our MessagePad devices).T:  Last cheap shot. When will connectivity on the MessagePad be as simpleas the Pilot?R:  When the MessagePad becomes a read-only device without true handwritingrecognition, without PCMCIA communications capabilities, without networksupport, without a TCP/IP stack, without the ability to add newapplications by simply installing packages, and without the ability toimport/export/and sync data with common desktop PIM's. Simplicity has it'scost. A carrot peeler is simple. It does one thing. The version of NCUwhich will ship with the MessagePad 2000 _does_ support one-tapAuto-Docking, with automatic backup and synchornization. But that's not thekey to the future. The real key to connectivity, from the user's point ofview, is seamless intelligence. Hardware and software which pays attentionto the user, and adjusts to the way the user wants to work. Not the otherway around. One size does not fit all. The Connection Engineering teamunderstands this. It's how we're designing the future.^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^* MARKETING FRONT*JOE BISHOP, SOLUTIONS MARKETING MANAGERQ. What are some of NSG's plans for education?A. Education is one of the several key markets the Newton Systems Group(NSG) has chosen to concentrate on in the the coming year. The recentannouncement of the eMate 300 marks the introduction of the first in aseries of purpose built products for education based on Newton technology.Education is moving out of the traditional school and college classroom andinto the educational campus, the community, the office, and the home. Themission being undertaken buy Apple's Information Appliance Division and itsvarious education groups is nothing short of launching the third wave ofeducational computing--putting affordable, portable tools for the modernworld in the hands of as many teachers and learners as possible.One of the critical measures of our mutual success, however, will be athriving community of Newton developers reaping the financial rewards thattheir vision, commitment, risk taking, and hard work so richly justify.Our job in the Solutions Marketing Group is to help make that happen.Q. What is your role within NSG?A. In taking on the position of Solutions Marketing Manager focusing oneducation, my job has two distinct but highly related aspects. First, as aperson with an education background who understands Apple's businessrelationship with education customers, my role is to help existing Newtondevelopers understand and exploit the tremendous potential of a fourbillion dollar per year growing market for technology in education. Thechallenge here is to help developers who may not have targeted education inthe past produce the kinds of tools that students, teachers, andadministrators need and value.Second, as the Newton Systems Group's manager of relationships withtraditional education developers, my role is to help them understand thekinds of applications that will perform well on products like the eMate,and to exploit the unique advantages of affordable, portable, connectabledevices. Devices, I might add, that the educational community has wantedfor a long time, but which have not been available before.As the primary business contact between NSG and education developers, Ianticipate that fulfilling these objectives will involve, among otherthings, facilitating relationships between developers and Apple's educationsales and marketing organizations, paring accomplished NewtonScriptdevelopers with partners from the education arena who are content andcurriculum savvy, and suggesting appropriate comarketing activities withinthe Newton Systems Group.^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^* VENDOR SPLENDOR*BALCONES SOFTWARE & SOFTCARE CLINICAL REVIEWEDBALCONES SOFTWARE ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Balcones Software, based in Austin, Texas has developed  Leverage,the easyto use database that brings the full power of desktop data management tothe Newton OS.

DietLog focuses on nutrition andpreventive medicine, and can be adapted to a variety of clinical settingswhere alteration in diet is a primary focus of treatment. DietLogincorporates key scientific principles that promote and reinforce positive,goal-oriented changes in eating behavior.The following is excerpted from a testimonial letter received from a memberof the technical community."I wanted to share my experience with DietLog. I had been looking for sometime for a support tool for my diet. I had no diagnosed health problems butwas becoming increasingly aware of a nutritional impact on long termhealth, particularly heart and cancer issues related to fat consumption andbeing overweight. I was about 230 lbs at a height of 5'9", but was notparticularly interested in weight-loss / cosmetic 'dieting'. I was lookingto assess, and possibly change, my lifestyle. If I had to say, I recallthinking I might like to be about 170lbs and 34-36" waist - about the sameas in my school years.... Today I'm at about 140lbs. I wear a size 28 jean,14.5" shirts. I feel great - energy to burn. I have good muscle tone.... Myresting heart rate is between 55 and 60... I feel great, I look great, andI'm enjoying my life, health AND diet.... DietLog continues to provide methe feedback to manage my eating with a focus now on eating enough. A fewmonths ago, this was put to the test when my Newton was stolen. It was asurprise to discover how integral it had become to my life. Not only was Iadrift in my agenda, but the extra effort in tracking my eating underlinedagain how critical DietLog was to allowing my success and why otherapproaches had failed. Thanks for a great product, Mike Milton"Additional Softcare products include FitLog, GlucoLog (diabetesmanagement), MDPad, RNPad, RDPad, and the epoch wireless point-of-caresystem. The latter is a client-server toolkit for constructing Newton-basedextensions to medical information systems, and incorporates wirelessserver, integration engine, intelligent agent, and knowledge basetechnologies.

You'reprobably wondering how to take advantage of this new capability. Thismonth's techie tip will give you a head start using NTK 1.6.3.The 2.1 OS can display PixMaps containing 16 or 32 bit direct or 1, 2, 4,or 8 bit indexed data.The new format can contain multiple bit depths such that an appropriatedepth is chosen for the screen's capabilities. This allows you to create asingle image which renders in black and whiteon earlier Newton devices, and in shades of gray on the new Newton devices,automatically!Note that PixMaps are mapped to the 16 shades of gray provided by the newNewton devices;there is no advantage in using huge 32 bit color images with this hardware.The 2.1 OS can also display format 2 'PICT' objects directly. You are nolonger required todistill your art work into black and white format 1 'PICT' objects. Now youcan simply use the GetResource or GetNamedResource functions in NTK forboth picture formats. Butremember, although pictures containing only drawing commands can be more memoryefficient than PixMaps, they are NOT completely interchangeable! You can't,for example,create a grayscale Extras drawer icon with NTK 1.6.3. Also, format 2pictures do not displayat all on 2.0 Newton devices, so watch out for this compatibility issue.Mac NTK 1.6.4 will address these issues by providing support for PixMaps inits MakePixFamily routine, and by its icon browser. These features will eventuallybe added toWindows NTK as well. The 1.3 Toolkit App when used with Mac NTK 1.6.4 willsupportthe grayscale screen shots needed for product advertisements, et cetera.^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^* TOP PROJECT*ALLPEN'S SOLUTION HELPS IN BREAST CANCER TREATMENTAllPen® Software developed the Mobile Breast Center Management PDA softwaresystem for Biopsys Medical, Inc., a public Irvine, California healthcareoriented firm. This system gave Biopsys the competitive edge their systemneeded for their clients.Biopsys already had developed a Window® and Machintosh® based breast cancerManagement (BCM) system application. This application was marketed and soldto breast center screening clinics. The BCM System was written to helpthose clinics track patients through the entire lesion screening andtreatment outcome cycle. A key component that the physicians of thoseclinics were looking for was mobility. Although the desktop BCM system wasvery robust, mobility was one feature which simply could not be achievedvia a desktop-based system.In January of 1996, Biopsys brought on AllPen Software to create a mobilehand-held BCM application. AllPen chose the Newton MessagePad-130 as theplatform for which to develop this application. The MessagePad's backlightcapability, combined with its excellent fit as a mobile data collectiondevice, made it an ideal platform.The Mobile BCM system was written in a way so that physician's andradiologists could quickly and easily perform mammography screening datacollection as well as create diagnostic reports. The data is collectedreal-time with the goal of "Beating" the existing pen/paper & dictationsystems currently deployed. AllPen and Biopsys made the mobile BCM datacollection system familiar to use and incorporated a simplistic userinterface so as to minimize the amount of steps necessary for the physicianto collect screening and lesion information.AllPen's software development process included extensive hands-on learningof both Biopsys' BCM desktop system, as well as many hours of physician andradiologist interviews to understand the current workflow and processesthat screening clinics utilize today. The AllPen staff worked closely withBiopsys' internal software engineering team and did several iterativesoftware prototypes of the mobile BCM application. The application took ona unique user interface including a "tap and find" Quick Patient Accessmechanism as well as a graphical lesion location description method. Inaddition, AllPen included an integration component so that data collectedin a mobile fashion could be quickly and easily communicated to and fromthe desktop system via wireless infrared connection.The mobile system also provided the physician's with a barcode option forthe mobile Newton MessagePad device. This allowed rapid scanning of bothpatient ID's and their associated mammography films.The mobile BCM system provided clinics with a significant savings. Oneclinic was quoted at saying they'd save upwards of $175,000 per year. Thissavings can be attributed to several factors...* concise recording and transmission of patient records * Ease of dataentry allowed physicians more diagnosis time per patient * Elimination ofcurrent 8-10 day dictation processWith the mobile BCM system, the clinic wins and the patient wins. Theclinic's save cost, while the patient wins because the physician is able tofocus their attention on the mammography films (not the dictation process).This increases the accuracy of lesion detection^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^*HOORAY FOR HOLLYWOOD*NEWTON IS A STAR ON THE SMALL SCREEN!The Apple MessagePad has been seen assisting Michael J. Fox, who plays ayoung ambitiouspolitical advisor to a big city Mayor in the popular new TV series "SpinCity." The Newton was alsoused by the heroine of the NBC movie thriller, "Pandora's Clock." Theheroine used a Newton tocommunicate with the "good guys" who wanted to assist her in saving a crewof airline passengers.^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^*CALENDAR        MARK YOUR CALENDAR!!|X X X X X||# # # # #|     * The Newton Systems Group will have a presence in|# # # # #|     the following upcoming events:|# # # # #|PDA Forum                                 December 4-6San Mateo, CAThe Hand-Held and PDA Forum  is the only event focused exclusively onintegratedsolutions using mobile technology.
