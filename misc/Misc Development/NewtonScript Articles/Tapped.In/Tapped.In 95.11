Our goalis to ship these products on the major PC platforms: Mac OS for the 68K andPowerPC, Windows 3.1, Windows NT and Windows 95. The primary tool for application development is Newton Toolkit (NTK).  NTK1.0 supports NewtonScript development in an interactive, visual layoutenvironment and was shipped along with the first Newton.  NTK 1.5 added anative NewtonScript compiler and a code profiler to allow developers to writefaster Newton apps.  It is the currently available from APDA.  NTK 1.6,scheduled to ship later this year, is the first PowerPC native version andprovides full support for Newton 2.0.  The Windows version of NTK 1.6 willbe ready for beta testing early next year. The primary tool for content delivery has been Book Maker.  Book Makerallows developers to create books that can be read on any Newton.  Thesebooks can range from simple content to fully interactive books withNewtonScript code extending content functionality.  While Book Maker is apowerful tool, it is not easy for the average Newton user to master.  Thatis why we're introducing Newton Press along with Newton 2.0.  Press allows endusers to easily download content to their Newtons using drag and drop.  Pressalso allows simple linking and table of contents generation.  We willcontinue to support both Press and Book Maker as we feel they each fill animportant need in our overall tools strategy. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^o   MARKETING FRONT     PATTY TULLOCH, NEWTON PLATFORM MARKETING, NSG              XX             XX         Q:  What is the new Newton 2.0 operating system?            XX      XX   XX           A:  Newton 2.0 is a major revision of the Newton        XXX                 operating system and is the result of more thantwo                            years of extensive customer, developer, andlicensee feedback and user testing.  It is designed to advance the Newtonplatform by providing improved organizational and communications capabilities,as well as the ability to integrate Newton PDAs with Windows and Mac OS-basedpersonal computers and enterprise environments.  The Newton 2.0 platform isalso designed to provide a more flexible and extensible architecture for agrowing number of partners and solutions providers, including independentsoftware vendors (ISVs), systems integrators (SIs), and value-added resellers(VARs). Some of the new features and solutions of the Newton 2.0 platform include: Organize your information:    o Improved handwriting recognition    o New external Newton keyboard    o First class built-in PIM applications including a new Calls application    and Outliner    o Exciting new third-party applications such as Pocket Quicken, Equate,    Gulliver, Filemaker Companion, Team Agenda and many more Communicate with others:    o Easier to use built-in internet mail client    o New fax receive turns the MessagePad 120 into a portable fax machine    o Access to a variety of e-mail services such as cc:mail, Microsoft Mail,    QuickMail, America Online and Compuserve    o Variety of communications methods: paging, analog cellular, CDPD,    wireless LAN and RF packetIntegrate with your personal computer:    o Newton Press, a new application for publishing electronic documents as    Newton books    o Newton Backup Utility, a free utility for backing up and restoring your    data    o Direct information synchronization between your Newton PDA and popular    Mac OS-based and Windows PC applications such as Now Up to Date, Now    Contact, MeetingMaker, Claris Organizer, Microsoft Schedule+ and many more Newton 2.0 will be available worldwide initially on the Apple MessagePad 120beginning December 1995, and is expected to be available on products fromNewton licensees in 1996.  Additional technology features that focus on givingcustomers the capability to connect with their personal computers andenterprise structures will also be available starting in December and thenthroughout the first two quarters of 1996.  The new, more open operating systemwill be accompanied by more flexible, productive tools for developers usingWindows or Mac OS-based personal computers, making it an ideal platform forvertical applications development. The installed base of MessagePad 120 customers will be able to upgrade theirNewton PDA for $109.  MessagePad 100 and 110 customers will be able to takeadvantage of a cash rebate program when they purchase a new MessagePad 120 withNewton 2.0.  Both programs will be available in December. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^o VENDOR SPLENDOR       NS BASIC AND O'NEIL ELECTRONICS REVIEWED    VV       VV     VV     VV          NS BASIC      VV   VV           ^^^^^^^^       VV VV            NS BASIC Corporation was founded in 1993 with the        VVV             express purpose of creating a BASIC development                        environment for the Newton. The product was initiallyreleased in July, 1994 and has been continuously improved.  Customers now existin over 30 countries and most of the US states.  Together, they form a broadspectrum encompassing Fortune 500 companies, government, university, businessand personal users. BASIC is probably the world's best known programming language, with moredevelopment taking place today in that language than ever before. NSBASIC for the Newton rides this popularity with a full implementation ofthe language with many extensions that take advantage of the richNewton environment. The latest release, 3.0, is expressly designed for Newton 2.0 OS devices.It features the ability to create standalone packages, fully indexed fileI/O, a full library of window objects, procedural or object orientedprogramming, serial and infrared communications and much more. NS BASICcan be programmed directly on the Newton, or via an attached Mac or PC. An interesting new feature of NS BASIC 3.0 is its ability to easilyaccess a database downloaded as a package by Apple's new Newton Pressproduct. This provides an easy way to download information to a Newtonwithout needing to use the Connection Kit. For more information, visit their web site at http://www.nsbasic.com, orcontact us at info@nsbasic.com or 416 264-5999. O'Neil Electronics^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Irvine, California-based O'Neil Electronics announced the launch of thenewly-enhanced microFlash, a ruggedized portable printer especially designedfor route accounting.  Weighing only 22.5 ounces, the microFlash utilizes awireless infrared port (Sharp ASK or IrDA).  It works with the Apple MessagePadand Newton operating system to issue two-inch wide receipts.  Worn on the beltof a field representative, the microFlash totally eliminates illegibleerror-prone handwritten receipts.  And with its unique rubberized housing, themicroFlash can withstand eight-foot drops to concrete without damage. Nearly all major rental car companies use the microFlash to issue receipts.Toyota is using the printer to place damage reports on cars arriving off ships,while Keno runners in Las Vegas and New Jersey are using the microFlash toprint gambling receipts. For more information about the product or to obtain the printer driver, callMike Freriks, director of sales, at (714) 458-0500, ext. 230. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^o  SI ACCESS            DO YOU HAVE A SUCCESS STORY?       @@     @@  @@             o We are in the planning stages for the January 11th       @@               Symposium, and would like to showcase your best Newton       |                MessagePad Applications.

David Fedor - DTS Engineer     ??     ??           ??           By now you've probably heard that once your MessagePad         ??             120 has been upgraded to Newton 2.0, you can rotate the                        screen and use your device in landscape mode... and you         ??             want to know how to support that in your own                        application.  It's fairly easy: modify your app to lay                        out your views correctly, and add a ReorientToScreen()                        method. If you originally designed your layouts using parent and/or siblingjustification, or if you have a small base view, you may not need any changesat all other than adding ReorientToScreen().  However, if your applicationhas hard-coded view sizes which it relies on in code, your job may betrickier.  Also, in some cases your layout may need to change moredramatically.  For example, look at the built-in calculator which placesthe keypad section to the right of the output instead of trying to squeezeit underneath. Once you've set up your app so that it lays out the interface correctly,you must add the ReorientToScreen method in your base view, as well as toany other views which you open with BuildContext().  This is the"prerequisite" to being allowed to open in landscape mode.  When the useris in landscape mode and tries to open your app, the Newton system willverify that you have a ReorientToScreen method.  If you don't, that meansyou don't support rotation and the user will be asked to rotate back.  But ifyou have that method, then your application will open. If your application is already open and the user hits the "Rotate" button,the system will send the ReorientToScreen message to you.  In this method,you must make whatever changes are necessary to re-layout your views.  Thisusually means closing and reopening your view if that isn't a slowoperation, or possibly just changing the relevant subviews and calling:SyncChildren(). There's a magic pointer, ROM_DefRotateFunc, which willclose and reopen your view, so if you're just going to close and reopenyour view, set your ReorientToScreen slot to contain that constant insteadof a function and you'll be all set. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^o  LAUGH--              --AT US, NOT WITH US       (X  X)                        The following Call-of-the-Day was submitted by Apple      @@    @@          Assistance Center agent Neil Haines in Sterling,                        Colorado:        @@@@                        Working with a MessagePad that would not start, I hadjust finished explaining to a caller that it was in a state which we call a'deep sleep.'

IOH enables                     engineers to collect and enter bridge inspectioninformation electronically by providing them with all pertinent informationrequired to perform inspections in accordance with the widely-used PontisBridge Management System.  Once collected, the data can be easily transferredto a PC running Pontis at the central office or to a laptop in the field.  IOHimproves the quality of the information collected, thereby improving bridgemanagement. IOH consists of an Apple MessagePad 120 with customized software that presentsthe user with an intuitive graphical user interface for entring elementcondition ratings and related information.  When connected to a host computer,the data is automatically formatted for Pontis.  By virtue of the electronicenvironment, the need for re-typing and storage of hand-written paper documentsis eliminated. IOH helps inspectors collect field data by intelligently providing an accurate,information-rich overview of the inspection elements.  Using thecontext-sensitive help screens, engineers can access element definitions,condition state language, and environment state language in the field withoutreferring to printed manuals.  In effect, the entire Pontis manual isaccessible to the user at the tap of a stylus.  IOH performs all calculationsautomatically, eliminating human arithmetic errors. For more information on IOH and other Trilon products, please contact SteveByrne by phone at (908) 828-6551, by fax at (908) 828-8503 or by e-mail atSBYRNE2@AOL.COM. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^o  PREMIER INTEGRATOR   CONGRATULATIONS WRIGHT STRATEGIES!         **        ****            Wright Strategies develops tools and services that     ***********        allow programmers and non-programmers to create       *** ***          solutions for field force automation which utilizes PDA      ***   ***         technology.  Currently Wright Strategies develops and                        markets FormLogic, a software application that allows                        users to create sophisticated, customized data                        collection applications. FormLogic consists of three separate applications that facilitate thedevelopment, deployment, and integration of field force automationapplications.  The FormLogic Builder allows all types of developers to quicklybuild applications on Windows or Mac OS-based computers.  The Formlogic Server,also available for both platforms, is used to distribute these applications toPDA devices in the field which are equipped with the FormLogic Client.FormLogic supports communications via serial cable, modem, cellular, andwireless LAN devices. Since its release in September, 1994, FormLogic has been implemented innumerous Fortune 500 organizations including Disney, Maritz Marketing Research,Taco Bell, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and Andersen Consulting.Its current installed base is over 1,100 users, with a growing network of ValueAdded Resellers and System Integrators.  At year's end, Wright Strategies willbegin shipping FormLogic 1.5.  This version adds support for the newly releasedNewton 2.0 Operating System. We congratulate Wright Strategies on the quality of its systems integrationsoftware development and its commitment to the Newton platform! ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^o     CALENDAR          MARK YOUR CALENDAR!!     |X X X X X|        o NEXT SYMPOSIUM:     |# # # # #|          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^     |# # # # #|        The next Annual Apple USA, Newton Symposium will be     |# # # # #|        held on Thursday, January 11, 1996.
