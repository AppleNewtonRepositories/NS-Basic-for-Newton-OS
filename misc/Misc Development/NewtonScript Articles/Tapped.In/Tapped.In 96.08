Their experience runs the gamut from telecom applications,e-mail transports and wireless applications. Netstrategy has been developing Newton software for over three years and theyhave written and have developed more e-mail related software for the Newtonthan any other developer. Recently, Netstrategy completed nine months ofdevelopment effort for the largest LTL truck transport application based onNewton technology to date. The customer, based in Montreal Quebec is one ofCanada's largest trucking firms. Once installation is complete over 2500 truckswill be equipped with a MessagePad running the Netstrategy application. "Our development efforts focus is e-mail and communications," states CelsoMaiolo, president and founder of Netstrategy Software. Until recently most oftheir software was being licensed and distributed by other companies such as CESoftware and Motorola. The strategy has changed however, with the explosivegrowth of Newton sales and the quality of the 2.0 Operating System, Netstrategywill now be marketing and distributing software under its own name. Netstrategy is particularly proud of the recent product introduction of EnRoutei-net, the first NIE based full featured POP/SMTP mail client for the Newton.EnRoute i-net is able to send native Newton data (text, frames and packages)seamlessly across the internet. This feature allows Newton to Newton transfersas well as transfers to and from desktop systems. As an example, a pricingcatalog prepared on the desktop using Newton Press can be mailed to EnRoutei-net users across the internet. When the user retrieves the message, theenclosed Newton book can be moved to their Extras drawer for immediate use! Other features of EnRoute i-net include automated scheduled connections, groupaddressing, message filtering, an extremely small memory footprint (<195K), amodular architecture and MIME compliance. Complete integration with the NewtonIn/Out Box insures that all third party Newton applications are now internetready. Netstrategy plans to release a Lotus cc:Mail version of EnRoute to addressanother large community of e-mail users in the fall. You can reach Netstrategyby contacting Celso Maiolo at 416-369-1996 or celso@netcom.ca. Planet Computing, Inc.^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Planet Computing, Inc., an Austin, Texas based company, was founded in August1995 to develop and market Newton productivity applications. Vea, pronouncedVe-Yuh, was Planet Computing's first commercial product, with LinkPAD added tothe Planet Computing line of products for the Newton platform. Vea for Newton 2.0, provides the ability to create Intelligent Diagrams. Veaallows you to select, drag and position onto Newton's screen, allows layeringof objects and also provides an underlying database that enables you to assignmultiple values such as cost, price, dimension, etc. to each object. Byproviding this database, you can create Intelligent Diagrams, speeding yourcreation of layouts, parts lists, price quotes, etc. System integrators and VARs can extend Vea through custom object templates andcan receive template creation tools to build industry specific templates freeof charge from Planet Computing. System Integrators and VARs should email theirrequests to the addresses below. Planet Computing has also announced it's LinkPAD product, turning theMessagePAD into a Portable Acquisition Device(PAD), enabling lab personnel toenter measurements at the time and point that they are taken, sign or initialthe input and wirelessly transmit the data directly into a LaboratoryInformation Management Systems. LinkPAD provides several significant advantages for laboratories: - Data canentered at the point of observation(meeting Good Laboratory Practices andFederal Code of Regulations Title 21) - Lab notebooks and paper entries can beeliminated - Electronic signatures can be captured- Date and Time stamping of data is integral - Time can synchronized withnetwork services - Lower cost per seat than PC's- Eliminates the need for hardwired PC/terminals - Smaller benchtop footprintthan a balance Planet Computing is currently in pilot programs with several companies on itsnext offering. They hope to have it available for announcement at the NovemberPC Expo. It will encompass both Newton and desktop components addressing avariety of industries. All Planet Computing products are aimed at providing mobile professionals withthe ability to collect and disseminate data on the Newton platform.

Henry Cate III, Newton DTS Engineer     ??     ??           ??           For a method where performance is critical an important         ??             point ot remember is allocating room for local         ??             variables takes a significant amount of time.  In a                        method with lots of variables, one option for speedingup performance is to create a frame with default variables, store this framein the base frame, then create a local frame which protos to the base frame.The performance hit in looking up the the proto chain can be more than balancedout by the savings of not having to allocate space from the heap for dozens oflocal variables.  For example: // A frame stored in the base view:baseFrame: {     someVar: "The start of lots of slots"     ........} ImportantPerformanceMethod: func (what, ever)Begin     local varFrame := {_proto: baseFrame}      // Do all the work hereEnd  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^*  LAUGH--              --AT US, NOT WITH US       (X  X)                        The following Call-Of-the-Day was submitted by the      @@    @@          Apple Assistance Center:         @@@@            The Apple Assistant agent was assisting a customer from                        National Semiconductor where Gil Amelio worked beforejoining Apple Computer, Inc. as CEO. o Caller: "So what do you think of Gil?" o Agent: "Well I've heard very positive things about him." o Caller: "Can we have him back?"^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^*  PREMIER INTEGRATOR   CONGRATULATIONS SUNBURST COMMUNICATIONS!         **        ****            Sunburst Communications, located in Pleasantville, NY,     ***********        has been a major player in the educational software       *** ***          marketplace since 1982.

The software provides sales force        *               management and remote access to mission critical        *               information.  The first implementation is for                        automotive consultant and strategic partner CardoneEnterprises of Orlando, Florida.  This version of the Steton client managementsystem, called Coach, is already installed and operational in select autodealerships. Auto manufacturers value the Coach for its ability to help impose higherstandards at the sales consultant level. Dealership managers can analyze salestrends, monitor customer satisfaction, and measure sales consultantproductivity. Sales consultants employ the product to build buyer profiles,remotely quote finance or lease payments, access inventory status and presentproduct or competitor information without sales manager interaction. Accordingto Scott Morgan of Cardone Enterprises, the Coach differentiates his firm andits customers. "The Coach provides an ongoing process improvement effort at thedealership, allowing managers to focus on customer satisfaction and dealershipprofitability." The Coach delivers a complete client management tool using the Apple Newton anda Windows NT server implementation. Steton's Coach Connect module intelligentlysynchronizes only the changed data between the Newton and the host NT databaseserver. From the Windows NT Server, the application also providesbi-directional data integration between the Coach and dealer informationsystems such as ADP and Reynolds. Steton possesses expertise in handheld technology, communications options, andintegration with corporate systems. Development currently focuses on automotivesolutions and client management tools for big-ticket and financial products.Steton Technology Group corporate offices are located at 12401 Hymeadow, Suite1B, Austin 78750.
