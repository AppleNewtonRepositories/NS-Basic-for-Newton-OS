Apple has arranged to preview the new Newton2.0 operating system and related Newton platform products in a dedicated boothat the upcoming industry trade show, COMDEX, which takes place in Las Vegas,Nov. 13-17, 1995 (Booth #4354, North Hall, Las Vegas Convention Center) as wellas Macworld Sydney, Australia, and Apple Expo, UK, the week of Nov. 6, 1995. Newton 2.0 is a major revision of the operating system and is the result ofmore than two years of extensive customer feedback and user testing.  It isdesigned to advance the Newton platform by providing improved organizationaland communications capabilities, as well as the ability to integrate NewtonPDAs with Windows and Mac(tm) OS-based personal computers and enterpriseenvironments.  The Newton 2.0 platform is also designed to provide a moreflexible and extensible architecture for a growing number of partners andsolutions providers, including independent software vendors (ISVs), systemsintegrators (SIs), and value-added resellers (VARs). "The PDA market continues to evolve, with the Newton platform at the forefrontof both technology and market leadership," said David Nagel, senior vicepresident, Research and Development, Apple Computer.  "Apple's strategy todrive the market forward hinges on delivering compelling mobile solutions,coupled with a business focus that aims to forge strong partnerships with keymarket players." Newton 2.0 will be available worldwide initially on the Apple(r) MessagePad(r) 120beginning in December, and is expected to be available on products from Newtonlicensees in 1996.  Additional technology features that focus on givingcustomers the capability to connectwith their personal computers and enterprise structures will also be availablestarting in December and then throughout the first two quarters of 1996.  Thenew, more open operating system will be accompanied by more flexible,productive tools for developers using Windows or Mac OS-based personalcomputers, making it an ideal platform for vertical applications development. Apple plans to support the Newton 2.0 platform through a variety of customer,developer, licensee and channel programs.  The company has worked closely withits developer, SI/VAR and licensee communities to bring a broad selection ofnew applications and solutions to market in the areas of informationorganization, communications, and integration with personal computers andenterprise structures. Apple's current distribution strategy for the MessagePad 120 includes a mix ofchannels, including computer, consumer electronics and specialty retailoutlets, as well as catalog sales.  Consumers will also be able to accessinformation about the Newton platform via the Newton homepage on the World WideWeb (http://www.info.apple.com/newton). Existing Apple MessagePad 120 customers will be able to upgrade their systemsbeginning in December.  Customers with the earlier MessagePad 100 and 110models will be able to take advantage of a rebate program beginning early nextyear. Apple Computer, Inc., a recognized pioneer and innovator in the informationindustry, creates powerful solutions based on easy-to-use personal computers,servers, peripherals, software, on-line services, and personal digitalassistants.  Headquartered in Cupertino, California, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL)develops, manufactures, licenses and markets products, technologies andservices for the business, education, consumer, scientific, engineering andgovernment markets in over 140 countries. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^o   INSIDE NSG        CINDY ROBERTS, DESKTOP APPLICATIONS, NSG     _________    | * * * * |       Q: What does the Desktop Applications Group do?    | *     * |    | *     * |       A: The Desktop Applications Group is chartered with    | * * * * |          developing Macintosh and Windows applications for the    |____@____|          Newton platform.  We provide "integration,    |_________|          integration, and more integration" to meet the key                         platform objective of Newton as a desktop companion.Our desktop products provide basic end-user solutions and developer tools tosimplify desktop connectivity over a variety of transports. In our end-user products, we're committed to the latest software platforms,including Macintosh, Windows 95, in addition to supporting the large installedbase of existing software platforms such as Windows 3.1.  The same is true forour developer products.  We'll always keep pace with the latest environment andare already working under CodeWarrior 7. You've probably heard of our current products: the Newton Connection Kits(NCKs), Newton Package Installers (NPIs) and Desktop Integration Libraries(DILs).  We've got our heads down working on the next generation of each.  Ourend-user products, NCK and NPI, give the user security with backup/restore,access to Newton applications with package download, and an easy way topopulate Newtons with import/export.  Watch for our new end-user productscoming to a store near you.  They'll have tighter integration with big namedesktop applications. Our main developer product, Desktop Integration Libraries, enables a desktopprogrammer to quickly create features to exchange desktop data with a Newtonapplication.  NOW Synchronize, the flagship DIL application, is a showcase forthe seamless integration possibilities of the DIL APIs.  Currently in beta, theDILs are available now in both Macintosh and Windows flavors to the developercommunity.  Our future API products will provide better ease-of-developmentsolutions to shorten development time. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^o   MARKETING FRONT     CINDY MCCAFFREY, NEWTON BRAND MANAGER, NSG              XX             XX         Q:  What does the Newton Brand Manager do?            XX      XX   XX           A:  As the Newton Brand Manager, I am responsible for        XXX                 building market awareness of the Newton brand. It's                            our goal to have the Newton brand stand out forApple and all Newton platform partners as the premium brand in the PDA market.I also work closely with Newton licensees and Apple's sales and marketing teamsin supporting their Newton products from a platform marketing perspective. One of my first tasks as the Newton Brand Manager was to establish a way todifferentiate the Newton platform brand from the MessagePad product brand.  Inthe past, Apple often used both brands interchangeably.  In the future however,you will see Apple using the Newton brand when referring to the platform andplatform products, with the Newton signature used as the predominate brandtrademark.  We are reserving the use of the MessagePad brand name only for theMessagePad product line.  MessagePad products will use the Apple logo as theirpredominate brand trademark; the Newton signature will be used as an"ingredient" brand. Over the past several months at Apple, we've been putting programs in place toestablish strong, separate brand identities.  You will see this distinction inour upcoming product packaging, marketing collateral and advertising.Materials for Apple MessagePad products will have a look that is distinctivefrom the look-and-feel we've designed for our Newton platform products andmarketing collateral.  This new focus is especially important as Newtonlicensees bring their own Newton PDA devices to market, and as you deliverproducts that work on all Newton PDAs, not just the Apple MessagePad. We consider the Newton platform to be not just a product, but an entire rangeof products and solutions: the Newton operating system, the developmentenvironment, the many products from Apple, and our SIs, VARs, and ISVs.  TheNewton platform also includes PDA products from a variety of manufacturers inthe telecommunications, computing, and consumer electronics industries. There's no doubt that the Newton brand continues to gain positive visibility inthe marketplace, thanks in large part to the support that you have given usthrough your product and marketing activities.  We look forward to working withthe entire Newton community to make the Newton brand the standard by which allother PDA devices are measured. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^o VENDOR SPLENDOR       NOW SOFTWARE AND ARDIS REVIEWED    VV       VV     VV     VV          Now Software, Inc.      VV   VV           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^       VV VV            Located in Portland, Oregon, Now Software is the        VVV             leading supplier of personal and workgroup productivity                        software applications for the Macintosh computerworldwide.

By Maurice Sharp - Senior DTS Engineer     ??     ??           ??           There has been a lot of discussion about compatibility         ??             recently.  Here is a summary of issues about which you                        should be concerned.  For more information you can         ??             check out the latest Developer CD for the compatibility                        article. There are two Laws of Compatibility and they are: 1) If something is notdocumented, do not use it.  2) Catch the exceptions, because they can occur(especially if you ignore Law 1). If you do violate the laws, test yourassumptions (if GetRoot().cardfile exists then...). Other general things you can do: use a platform file function if it is provided(things like kRegisterCardSoupFunc and kRegFindAppFunc); do not use globalvariables like cardSoups, extras and userConfiguration... use accessors (e.g.kGetUserConfigFunc, kSetUserConfigFunc); do not use undocumented magicpointers.  We could change them... a magic pointer to a bitmap could suddenlybecome a template; never assume GetStores()[1] is the card.  The only safeassumption is that GetStores()[0] is the internal store; do not assume yoursoup will exist on every store... use AdddToDefaultStore on a UnionSoup; do notassume anything about screen size or aspect ratio.  Instead test the size.  Ifyour application does not support it, notify the user and close your app; donot assume strings will be 2 bytes per character and null terminated; integersare at least 30 bits wide NOT 30 bits wide; use kSendFunc.  Do not directlysend messages to the IOBox; use SetValue to view or system values; do not relyon closing order in viewQuitScript; do not assume anything about built-in apps(features, slots, existence, default open state, ...). ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^o  LAUGH--              --AT US, NOT WITH US       (X  X)                        The following Call-of-the-Day was submitted by Dan      @@    @@          Forbes of the Apple Assurance Newton Support group in        @@@@            Sterling, Colorado: >From a Man with a MessagePad 100 with a problem that it wouldn't power up. o  Agent:  Did you try the power reset?o  Caller: No.o  Agent:  Hold down the power button, press reset for 5 seconds then release           the reset.o  Caller: Still no response.o  Agent:  Well we are going to have to cold boot the unit and then do a           restore.o  Caller: Okay.o  Agent:  Pull out the backup battery and the main battery.o  Caller: While I am doing that can I put you on hold a minute?o  Agent:  Yes sir. Heard in the background: "I want two cheese burger's french fries, a largechocolate shake and a small coke!"

The database system would identify the delivery zone based on thename of the addressee and print a bar code label to help with tracking andsorting the items.  Once the items were delivered, recipient signatures werecollected on paper manifests and stored in a file cabinet at the day's end. Now, with Bear River's system in place, information on incoming items isscanned into the database using a TPS Mobile Wand 400 contact bar code scannerand data on packages to be delivered is downloaded to the MessagePad.  Couriersare able to key in the recipient's alpha-numeric mail-stop and receive therecipient's proper name, department, building, and a diagram showing the theirlocation on the delivery route.  At the end of the day, collected data(including signatures) is uploaded from the MessagePads and consolidated in theexisting database.  This system has helped the Mail Receiving Department atApple eliminate paper manifests, improve delivery time and tracking, and allowfor faster responses to delivery inquiries. For more information on Bear River Associates, their system integration anddevelopment services, or their products, call 510-644-9400 or send an e-mail toinfo@bearriver.com. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^o  PREMIER INTEGRATOR   CONGRATULATIONS VISIBLE INTERACTIVE!         **        ****            Visible Interactive creates and produces interactive     ***********        touring systems designed for information-intensive       *** ***          environments such as museums, historical sites, and      ***   ***         national parks.
