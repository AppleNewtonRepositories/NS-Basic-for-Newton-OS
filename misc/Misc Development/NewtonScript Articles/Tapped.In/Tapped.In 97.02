An uninformedoutsider's view of the situation coupled with relentless doom-n-gloomreports in the popular media could lead one to believe Apple was in theprocess of "shutting-down" the Newton division.  This is not the case.I want to take this opportunity to provide you with update on ourcontinued commitment to our products and to you, our developers andcustomers.  We are committed to complete marketing and sales efforts tolaunch our two exciting products this quarter. Both of these productsare in manufacturing ramp and are on target to ship later this quarter.And we continue to develop future products.On the marketing front, to support the shipment of the MP2000 and theeMate 300 we are participating in a number of events over the nextcouple of months including the following:* Demo '97 (Feb 10-12)* HIMMS - Healthcare show (Feb 17-20)* MacWorld Tokyo (Feb 19-21)* FETC - Education Show (Feb 27- Mar 1)* CEBIT - one of the biggest shows in Europe, held in Hanover, Germany(March 16-23)In addition to these events, eMate 300 ads are beginning to appear ineducation focused publications such as Education Week, ElectronicLearning and Technology & Learning.  We will be advertising the MessagePad 2000 between April and June in both Windows and Mac publications,as well as general business dailies.  Other marketing activities for theeMate 300 and MessagePad 2000 include conducting direct mail campaignsto the school superintendents in March and  the MessagePad installedbase in April, revamping our website to include more customer focusedinformation  on our platform, new products, success stories fromcustomers using our technologies, etc., and utilizing our PR engine toregain momentum amongst key industry press and analysts.On the engineering and development front, we are continuing the internalefforts on our  product roadmap for future Newton-based products.  Thereare currently projects underway at all phases of the development cycle -from early concept to full development  These projects build upon thestrength of the MessagePad 2000 and eMate 300 and focus on futurecustomer needs and expectations in mobile computing.In light of the recent reorganization of Apple Computer, the NewtonSystems Group remains intact under the direction of Jim Groff andmyself.  The Newton Systems Group continues to be focused exclusively onthis marketplace and expect to be the leader in the category.  Thefeedback that we have received from analysts and others who havereceived "pre-release" units has been extremely positive.  Thecomparisons to WinCE devices has been very favorable and we areanticipating exceptional response when we begin shipping these twoproducts later this quarter.  Advance orders on these products isrunning above expectations.The Newton platform is alive and well, and I hope we can count on yourcontinued support.Thank you for your support and commitment to the Newton platform,together we will succeed.Sandy Benett Vice President, Newton Systems Group^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Q: Will Apple continue to support Newton for the long term?We continue to enhance our product roadmap for future Newton-basedproducts. We have a number of product concepts in all phases of thedevelopment cycle. These concepts build upon the strength of theMessagePad 2000 and eMate 300 and focus on future customer needs andexpectations in mobile computing.In the short term, we are moving full speed ahead on getting what webelieve are two excellent products to market. The eMate 300, targeted ateducation, and the MessagePad 2000, aimed primarily at businessprofessionals, are both mobile computers, based on the Newton operatingsystem. We have continued to support and invest in this platform for anumber of years. Based on the positive response from customers andmedia, we believe our experience and perserverence with the Newton ispaying off.Q: Where does Newton fit in Apple's new organizational structure?The Newton Systems Group continues to be a self-contained unit,comprising all the professionals needed to bring excellent Newton-basedproducts to the customer, from the engineers who develop the products tothe sales and marketing teams who support them and work side by sidewith the hundreds of Newton developers.Q: Is Apple considering shutting down the Newton Systems Group?We have never stated any intention to shut down the group. We haveclearly shown our commitment in getting new Newton-based products tomarket. Our focus is on bringing the MessagePad 2000 and the eMate 300,to market next month and supporting them.Q: When will Apple finish it's evaluation of the Newton and otherprojects?We are closely evaluating every aspect of our business. As Dr. Ameliostated at the annual Shareholders meeting, Apple expects this evaluationto take place over the next month. With regard to Newton, we have twoexcellent products about to enter the market, the eMate 300 andMessagePad 2000, that we are very excited about.Q: How close are you to shipping the eMate 300 and MessagePad 2000?Weare on target to ship the eMate 300 and MessagePad 2000 this quarteras previously announced.Q: Why will these new products perform better in the market then pastNewton based products?These new products represent the culmination of Apple's years ofexperience in developing the Newton platform to create products thatmeet users needs. The MessagePad 2000 is a handheld mobile computer forthe business professional and provides desktop connectivity to bothWindows and Macintosh computers. Core applications ranging from e-mailand web access to personal productivityare all built in. The MessagePad2000, which weighs 1. 4 pounds, features the 160 MHz StrongARM processorwhich makes it one of the fastest handheld computers on the market. Itis so power thrifty that four AA batteries can provide three to sixweeks of typical usage.The eMate 300 is a low-cost mobile computer designed for education whichfeatures multi-platform desktop and network connectivity. Created withinput from educators, it offers an affordable way to make technologyaccessible to more students than ever before. With a battery life of upto 24 continuous hours before recharging, the eMate 300 makes itpossible for students to work for long periods of time wherever theywant.Both products feature Apple's pioneering and award winning Newtonoperating system.^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^*INSIDE NSG*            DAVID AUSTIN, DIRECTOR OF ENGINEERINGQ. Welcome to the Newton group, David. You started just before theholidays. What do you think so far?A. Thanks for the welcome. I'm extremely excited about working with sucha great group of committed people, both within the company and out inthe developer community.I've spent most of my energy coming up to speed on the specific demandson the NSG engineering group. We are responsible for all of theengineering, both hardware and software, that make up the products thatApple ships to customers, as well as providing the core technologies forour licensing partners.Q. What do you see as the primary goals of the Newton Engineering group?A. A primary goal of the organization is to continue to build greatproducts for our customers. The eMate 300 and MP2000 are perfectexamples of us working toward this goal. In addition we have to makesure that the technologies that we produce in creating these productsare able to be utilized by our licensees. The goal is to increase theoverall number of Newton products out in the market. This should allowus to maximize the impact of our technologies and create a strong marketfor our developers' products, as well.To achieve the above goal requires a close collaboration between theEngineering organization and NSG's Marketing group, as well as theSupport & SQA group. A representative from both these groups sit on mystaff to make sure that the voice of the developer and customer are apart of how we prioritize what projects to work on. We have a greatgroup of extremely creative and talented engineers here, but often timesthe ideas we need to execute on come from the developer community. Myphilosophy is that good ideas are good ideas, regardless of where theycome from.Q. You've been at Apple for a while. What is your history here?A. I started in October of 1990. I was hired into the Macintosh Toolboxgroup to investigate storage facility technologies. This led toinvestigations that created Bento, and then initiated the OpenDocprogram with Jed Harris and Kurt Piersol. I managed the OpenDoc groupfrom almost the very beginning, and stayed involved through our firstcustomer ship in 1995. I then went on to work in a group focused oneducation specific software. After a great sabbatical this last summer,I returned and began the search for the best fit for me within Apple.The Newton group was my first and only real choice. The opportunity tocontribute to an organization that makes such useful and innovativeproducts is exactly where I want to be.^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^*MARKETING FRONT*       JODIE GILMORE, PRODUCT MARKETING MANAGERWhat is your role in the Newton Systems Group?I am the Product Marketing Manager for the new eMate 300.As Product Marketing Manager, what are your main responsibilities?My goal is to understand the needs of our target customers and thecurrent trends of the market.  This information will allow us to defineour product strategy.  Working with engineering, I define productfeatures based on our customer needs. To make sure developers are awareof and hopefully creating the software and hardware solutions which arecritical to the product strategy, I coordinate efforts with theSolutions Marketing group. I also work closely with the OutboundMarketing group to develop the product positioning and help define theadvertising, collateral, promotional and PR efforts.The eMate 300 is a very innovative product and a new concept for theNewton OS, can you tell us more about it?The eMate 300 is the first Newton OS based product which departs fromthe handheld form factor. The idea came about when schools began askingApple for an affordable mobile computer which was lightweight, rugged,easy to use, had extremely long battery life, and offered goodcommunications and connectivity options. After realizing that the NewtonOS was the perfect platform to meet these customers needs, the NewtonSystems Group signed up to build the product. The result is the eMate300 which will be available to schools at the end of this quarter.How has the product been received?Since the official announcement in late October, the interest andexcitement around the eMate 300 has been overwhelming. Apple's educationcustomers are furiously requesting product briefings, demo's andevaluating their buying plans. Teachers and administrators are thrilledwith the eMate 300 and believe this is the perfect product to make themost of their budgets and improve access to technology in the classroom.Even outside of education, the eMate 300 has been enthusiasticallyreceived. The question being asked by many who see the product is "whencan I buy one too?" The eMate 300 is also receiving incredible industryattention. This fall, the eMate 300 was a finalist for "Best of Comdex"in the laptop category and Popular Science listed the eMate 300 as oneof their Top 100 new products.Why should Newton Developers be interested in eMate?The eMate 300 is shaping up to be a very popular new product in theEducation market and Apple's education customers are always looking foreducational software solutions for their curriculum. With theenthusiastic response to eMate, Apple plans to distribute the product toconsumers by the second half of 1997. Having new and innovative productsfrom developers will be a key component to the success of this productthat could be a very profitable business.^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^* VENDOR SPLENDOR*    IAMBIC & WALLETWARE REVIEWEDIAMBIC^^^^^^iambic Software, located in downtown San Jose, Californiais a rapidly growing software development company focused on developingfull bodied commercial applications for the Apple Newton MessagePad.TimeReporter, time and expense tracking and billing, iambic's firstapplication, has matured into a market proven mission critical tool usedby attorneys, consultants and professionals that bill by the hour or bidjobs on a fixed fee basis.Iambic followed TimeReporter with the introduction of Action Names, acontact management utility designed specifically for the Apple NewtonMessagePad. Action Names strikes a chord which users because of its timeand step saving features. Scheduling events, calls and tasks with peopleis easier with the one tap controls and pick lists that schedule theevent, enter the person, place, time and date, and phone number reducingor eliminating time spent manually writing. An at a glance daily orweekly agenda cleanly shows scheduled activities sorted by type andtime. Each name card has an additional view called the contact history.The contact history report is generated automatically from scheduledactivities and includes items like notes and spreadsheets that have beenlinked to the name. Action Names produces the kind of clear organizedinformation that successful professionals require without the hours ofeffort.Paper Pak is a unique collection of intelligent stationary thatdramatically extends the notes application of the Newton OS 2.0operating system. Added to the New button in the notepad application areeight familiar formats based on real world pieces of paper, impressivenew capabilities and scores of useful tools. Paper Pak is modular whichallows the stationery to be added individually.The phone message slip is modeled after a familiar pink while you wereout slip. It easily captures all relevant information and keeps track ofcalls attempted and completed. Graph paper uses the Apple NewtonMessagePad's drawing tools and adds features like snap to grid andvariable grid size. A professional memorandum and personalized note makefaxed or printed communication from the Newton look polished andprofessional. Using quick pick tools on the direction taking paper, it'seasy to take down and permanently store directions given verbally. Thetwo column paper makes it possible to use the notepad as you would apaper notepad with a line drawn down the middle. Compare alternatives,keep score, make lists or enter calculations. Smart math tools add,subtract, multiply, divide, average and solve an equation. A named notemakes it possible to associate a notepad note to an individual in thenames file. Blank paper has no lines and is the classic blank sheet ofpaper.Paper Pak further eliminates the need to carry paper based informationwhich can now be stored and easily accessible within the MessagePad.Iambic Software just recently introduced Sub Patrol, an action adventuresub hunting game for the Newton OS 2.0 and later.Sub Patrol is a truly addictive game where you command one of threesurface ships with varying capability and weaponry. An increasinglyaggressive enemy traverses the waters beneath your ship launchingtorpedoes to the surface. Accumulate points by sinking enemy subs.Progress through higher levels of difficulty where you accumulate moreweapons. Rescue survivors of enemy ships before they become shark baitand you are rewarded with gratuitous repair of your ship's hull oradditional sea planes or helicopters. Use the powerful magnet you dropfrom your helicopter to thwart the enemy's efforts to disable your shipwith its metal cased torpedoes.Iambic's web site http://www.iambic.com has detailed information andscreen shots for all products.WALLETWARE, INC.^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Last year, WalletWare, Inc. released a totally redesigned versionof their flagship Newton product, ExpensePlus 2.0. With over24,000 users, ExpensePlus is now one of the top market leadersin the Newton industry. ExpensePlus simplifies the ability tocapture expense information in real-time while traveling, thensend the expense data directly to an expense report on a desktopcomputer without having to export and import the data! This isan opportunity for SIs and VARs to offer a complete solution fortheir customers that includes capturing expense data andautomatically filling in their clients own custom expensereport form.For Macintosh users, ExpensePlus can send the data from the PDA toseveral Mac applications -- such as Excel, FileMaker, or InformedFiller. ExpensePlus will automatically launch the Mac application, openthe customer's own custom expense report, and fill in the dataautomatically! And you don't have to do any programming in ExpensePlusto link it to most expense report forms. For Windows users, some VisualBasic programming is required. Once you've completed the initial setupfor either platform, your customer simply taps a button on hisMessagePad, and the expense report is automatically generated on thedesktop computer.ExpensePlus ships with many expense report templates for MicrosoftExcel, FileMaker Pro, and Informed Filler. If a customer doesn't requirea custom expense report, they might choose to use one of the includedtemplates. ExpensePlus can also print or fax (including your digitizedsignature!) directly from the MessagePad in a wide variety of summaryreports or expense itemized listings.Other features:* Automatic foreign currency conversions* Create custom categories with your own choices of icons* Bar graphs and pie charts with drill-down capabilities* "Per diem" limit tracking by category (or category groups)* Track expenses by credit card, cash, or checks. Identify whichcredit cards are paid directly by your company, and ExpensePlus willtrack which expenses are reimbursable or not.* Track expenses by client, job costing, profit center or any user-definedclassification.*Track odometer readings for mileage reimbursement amounts* Label expenses as business (reimbursable) or personal(tax deductible or not).One of ExpensePlus' most useful features is the ability to createexpense slips from the Notepad using the Expense stationery. The nexttime your customer launches ExpensePlus, it will automatically read inall of the expense slips from your notepad.With all of this power, ExpensePlus rivals even the most powerfulexpense reporting applications on desktop computers -- yet it runs on aNewton PDA. This may make it seem like ExpensePlus might be difficult tolearn or use -- but its icon-driven interface is surprisingly simple andelegant. Try it yourself -- download a free demo of the product fromWalletWare's web site at www.walletware.com.

Both the MessagePad 2000 and eMate 300 willhave these chips. Since each unit has a unique number it can be used forinventory tracking, copy protection, or just geek factor. Note the ROMserial number is NOT the same as the serial number on the outside of theunit.  The ROM number is meant for programmers, not users.You access the serial number by calling a function that is provided as amagic pointer. The function is accessed by the constantROM_GetSerialNumber. This constant is defined in the Newton OS 2.1platform file. The function will return a binary object that is 8 byteslong. If there is no serial number chip, the function will return nil.As an example of usage, you can get a human readable hex dump of theserial number by using the StrHexDump function.So an example call would be:StrHexDump(call ROM_GetSerialNumber with (), 0) #C41A2E5"0000000001548423"Note: Since your code is likely to run on non-OS 2.1 units, you shouldcheck to make sure the magic pointer is valid by wrapping your call in atry/onException block:try sn := call ROM_GetSerialNumber with () onException |evt.ex| do nil;if sn then ...^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^*TOP PROJECT*      TBS IS ON THE BEAT WITH THE DERBYSHIRE POLICETBS Systems, located in Derbyshire, UK recently started A pilot programfor the Derbyshire Constabulary. MessagePad 120/130's have replaced theofficer's little black books. Instead of jotting down details of a crimeand typing them up later, officers on the beat are now able to enter theinformation into their MessagePad and transmit it back to the hostcomputer over the GSM wireless network.At the scene of a crime, the officer on patrol will take the crimedetails down by filling in forms on the MessagePad. All the informationthat is needed by the police can be entered into the MessagePad. Theinformation is validated and formatted correctly for transmission to thehost. Specific details about the type of crime can be reported, forexample, if the crime was a burglary every conceivable method ofentering the house is listed for the officer to choose from.The MessagePad also stores approximately 2500 post codes and addressesfor use in validating the victim addresses, scene of crime addresses,etc.This information is then transmitted back to the host, which will replywith a police crime number to allow the victim to progress withinsurance claims immediately.An entire incident can be recorded in a matter of minutes, whereaspreviously it was taking in excess of 20 minutes for the officer to typethe information into a terminal when he/she returned to the policestation. Also the information entered into the MessagePad is promptedfor and validated, thus reducing the risk of essential information beingmissed.Also on pilot with Derbyshire Police is a system developed by TBS foraccess to the Police National Computer (PNC), used by officers on thebeat for online checking of vehicles and persons. The original methodused by officers to obtain information about a vehicle or person was forthe officer to radio into the control desk and ask for a PNC check to bedone. An operator would then enter the request into a terminal, andradio the results back to the officer. This was a very laborious task,and it could take some time for the officer to receive the informationrequested, especially if there are a lot of vehicles to check.TBS has developed an online system using MessagePad 120 and 130's andGSM cellular technology to allow the officers to link directly to thePNC and request the information themselves. Thus reducing the amount oftime it takes to get information back to the officer, and reducing theworkload on the control room.Information received about each vehicle can be very detailed, forexample, if the vehicle was stolen, if it was used in any robberies, ramraids, who owns the vehicle, has it been re-sprayed, engine size, ect.It also mentions if the vehicle details are interesting and if theofficer would like to know more about the owner, a person check isissued at the touch of a button.The information received from a person check is even more detailed. Itwill inform the officer if the person is dangerous, missing, wanted, anydistinguishing features, aliases, driving licence status, just to name afew.The officer out on the beat can fill in up to 15 vehicle registrationnumbers, or a person's details, name, sex, height etc. The MessagePadwill then log-on to the PNC Bridge server which will enter the detailsinto the PNC, request the information and transmit the results back tothe officer.This system has greatly increased the officers use of the PNC. Quickaccess to vehicle and person information has allowed officers to do morechecks in less time, allowing the officers to work more efficiently.For more information please contact; TBS Systems Ltd.
