Many people think a|_________|	Fellow is supposed to just sit around and ponder theimponderable all day, but in practice each one takes adifferent tack. Apple Fellow Alan Kay is involved with an experimental school where he can try new programming paradigms with his favorite teachers: kids. Apple Fellow Don Norman, whose stated mission is to study the impact of computers on society, is currently running ATG. Apple Fellow Guy Kawasaki is once again evangelizing and strengthening our developer support program. Obviously we're all in the trenches with our sleeves rolled up rather than at our desks with our feet propped up.Recently, I've been heavily involved in the next generation Newton Operating System. I feel Newton is a keystone to Apple's future because of the maturation of the desktop business. We have a good lead in the PDA arena and I think with continual software and hardware development we will only strengthen our position and lengthen the lead of our platform. Given my experience with the Macintosh, where the original team lost momentum for two years, I feel strongly that following through is very, very important. The software team has been working overtime during the last year to ensure this will happen. Everybody on the Newton team looks forward to the continued support from our SIs, VARs, and ISVs. I promise you that the new software effort will only be surpassed by future hardware and software from Apple, our licensees, and developers.^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ o INSIDE NSG	DAVE TURNBULL, PROGRAM MANAGER, APPLE PRODUCTS, NSGXXXX	Q: What does the Apple Products Group do?XXXX XX	A: The Apple Products group is responsible for theXXX	development, manufacturing and support of Applelabeled Newton systems and accessories, includingthe MessagePad product line as well as the development and integration of key technologies that support the Newton platform. The group is organized into project teams that work very closely with Product Marketing, Operations, and our Worldwide Sales groups to identify target Apple markets and customer requirements. We then use this information to design and develop complete product solutions based on the core Newton hardware and software technology. These solutions often contain products or technologies from our developer community and system integrators. The primary goal of this group is to further the advancement of the Newton platform as THE STANDARD for PDA-class products, with the introduction of compelling product solutions that demonstrate the power and versatility of Newton technology.^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ o VENDOR SPLENDOR	REAL WORLD SOLUTIONS AND EX MACHINA REVIEWEDVV	VVVV	VV	Real World SolutionsVV VV	^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^VV VV	Real World Solutions of Campbell, CA will soon shipVVV	server and client software that will allow Newton usersto communicate with enterprise networks over dial-upand wide-area wireless networks. The software embraces a new paradigm known as "client-agent-server" which allows network-efficient access of data on the corporate LAN for mobile clients. Users can communicate with Microsoft Mail and cc:Mail systems. In addition, a data browser application allows users to access and update Lotus Notes, Microsoft SQL, Sybase SQL and Oracle SQL, Clipper, FoxPro, Paradox and dBase.An SDK is available to developers who wish to create custom applications for the Newton Platform and/or custom agents on the server. The server software requires a Windows NT platform. The software is scheduled for general availability in September. For more information, contact Real World Solutions at 408-364-7330 or e-mail Applelink GETREAL or Internet info@getreal.com. Ex Machina Inc.^^^^^^^^^^^^^^One of the oldest active Newton communications developers, Ex Machina is committed to making the Newton Platform a major factor in both wireline and wireless communications by supporting commercial and corporate developers, VARs and SIs. PocketCall 2.0 recently debuted at Boston MacWorld with full VT100 emulation, meaning that for the first time, VARs and integrators can seamlessly meld Newton Systems right into the existing communications infrastructure of major corporate, government and institutional clients. The ability to run ANY application on a host computer that takes advantage of VT100 also means that every Newton PDA (even an original MP) now has direct access to the World Wide Web (and UseNet news groups, text file FTP, and more!) through any Internet Service Provider offering a 'shell' account. PocketCall 2.0 comes complete with a special onscreen keyboard for Lynx, the popular text-based web browser, and a full set of scripts for online services. For developers, the other exciting news is that PocketCall 2.0 now includes a substantially expanded scripting language, completely available under program control. Registered users of PocketCall 1.0 will receive a free, automatic upgrade to 2.0 in late August; developer copies are available immediately.On the wireless front, Ex Machina is pleased to make available to developers, VARs and SIs two utilities that will give you the ability to easily create exciting wireless applications. Notify! for Newton adds a 'page' command to the Newton's action menu and Newton Script, allowing any application to instantly send a full text message to any alphanumeric pager or data receiver. Update! for Newton handles the other direction, working with the Socket PageCard wireless receiver to bring messages sent (under program control, if desired) from Notify! for Newton, Macintosh, Windows or DOS into the inbox. Now your application can be truly mobile! For more information about how we can support you with rock solid Newton wireline and wireless communications solutions, please call Scott Samios or Doug Walner at (800) 238-4738. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ o SI ACCESS	ATTENTION DEVELOPERS!

ADDING PICTURES TO YOUR APPLICATION?? ??	Adding pictures is an easy way to make your application??	??	more intuitive for the user. You can easily??	incorporate a picture into your package by including a??	resource file in your application. To add the desiredpicture to your application use a clPictureView view.??	When you're ready to choose a picture, use the NewtonToolkit's "picture editor" to select the picture forits icon slot. Alternatively, at compile time you caninclude the picture in a slot within your application base view or a photo using the GetPictAsBits function. When your application wants to display the picture, all you need to do is draw it in your viewDrawScript using CopyBits or DrawShape. Remember that if you draw the picture outside of your viewDrawScript, use the DoDrawing view method to set up proper clipping. For more information on pictures, see the Drawing section of the Q&A for a complete discussion of shapes and bitmaps.^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ o LAUGH--	--AT US, NOT WITH US(X X)Customer Service Humor@@ @@	^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^@@@@	The following Call-of-the-Day was submitted by BarbKelley of the Apple Assurance Newton Support Group inSterling, Colorado:o Caller: I just watched the new Steven Seagal movie and saw that he had an Apple MessagePad and the screen lit up in the dark. I want to know how I can get my MessagePad to do this?o Agent: Explained that his MessagePad does not have the capability to do this.Hollywood is always one step ahead of us! ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ o PREMIER PROJECT	JOHNS HOPKINS HOSPITAL AND NEWTON TEAM UP^	Physicians and health care case managers at Johns^ ^ ^	Hopkins Hospital recently completed a 10-month pilot^	^	^	project to assess the utility of the Apple MessagePad.^	The two groups found the MessagePad when combined^	with PD Tracker, a software application developed^	by the hospital that runs on the Newton platform, tobe an effective replacement for their currentpaper-based system. The physicians and case managers who tested the product found that the Apple MessagePad improved the documentation process and assisted in achieving clinical outcomes. The Johns Hopkins study also found that health care professionals appreciate the device's many other features including minimal training requirements, size (i.e., fits in a lab jacket pocket), portability, and attractive price performance. Because of such features the MessagePad was found to be superior over competing automated devices. Additionally, the Apple MessagePad devices help case managers access a variety of information including patients' addresses and phone numbers, emergency contacts, insurance providers and managed care organizations. They also provide users with information about referring M.D.'s and medical reference material.^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ o PREMIER INTEGRATOR CONGRATULATIONS PHOENIX MARKETING! **	The Phoenix Marketing Group provides computer-based****	support to the sales and marketing departments of the***********	Health Care Industry.
