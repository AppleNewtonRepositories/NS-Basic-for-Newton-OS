The                       beta version of NIE is available immediately free ofcharge to all Newton developers worldwide. This beta release will be availablevia electronic distribution by submitting a request to:NewtonDev@applelink.apple.com. The final NIE release is expected to beavailable in June 1996. NIE offers a suite of connectivity tools that allowsInternet-based solutions development for the Apple MessagePad.  NIE will enableNewton developers to deliver Internet-based solutions such as WEB, mail, news,Telnet and FTP clients. "The Newton TCP/IP stack for developers is a key component to implementingour Internet strategy for the Newton platform," said Sandy Benett, acting vicepresident of Apple's Newton Systems Group. "In the very near future, we canexpect to see an exciting range of innovative Internet-based solutions forNewton, developed specifically for the mobile customer who requires seamlessaccess to the Internet and/or an Intranet, regardless of location." "For the past two years, Internet connectivity efforts have been focused onthe desktop environment," said Andrew Seybold, editor-in-chief, AndrewSeybold's Outlook on Communications and Computing. "The growth ofInternet-based enterprise and commerce applications is driving an increasedneed for mobile Internet connectivity. High-functionality PDA platforms likeNewton will play a significant role in providing that connectivity." In addition to TCP/IP, Newton Internet Enabler also provides support forstandard Internet protocols such as PPP, SLIP and UDP, a dialer with a scriptengine and a domain name resolver (DNR). Applications can now be developedwhich ultimately allow customers to connect to an Internet Service Provider(ISP) whether it be via a public ISP or through a corporate Intranet. World Wide Developers Conference Report^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Thanks to all of you who came to the Apple WWDC May 13-17 at the San JoseConvention Center.  There was a terrific turnout for the opening session withApple CEO Gil Amelio giving the keynote speech.  Gil talked about the directionof Apple, and a number companies gave short presentations of their support.Apple's commitment to Newton Technology was discussed a number of times.  Dr.Amelio allocated time for one demonstration during the presentation--a NewtonMessagePad wirelessly connected to the internet.  You can imagine how proud theNewton group was!  The Newton Group sponsored 3 sessions on Friday, whichdiscussed in detail our tools and development environment.  We were pleasedthat the room was full for all 3 sessions.  Thanks to all of you whomparticipated!   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^* VENDOR SPLENDOR       LANDWARE RELEASES X-PORT    VV       VV     VV     VV          X-PORT - NEWTON CONNECTIVITY FOR 2.0      VV   VV           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^       VV VV            LandWare recently released X-Port, a 2.0 OS        VVV             connection utility written by ICS, the makers                        of NewtCase. X-Port facilitates the transfer of notes,outlines, lists, contacts, meetings, events, screen shots and packages(non-copy protected) from a Newton PDA to a Macintosh or Windows PC.

Ford Motor Company has contracted with                        AllPen to develop software on the Newton that will aidengineers in gathering data during crucial test drives on new model cars.  Fordengineers currently use pen and paper to score hundreds of variables on the newcars.  The data is then entered into the computer after the week long testdrive is complete.  The results are available to the engineers generally twoweeks after the drives.  With the help of AllPen's custom software and theNewton, Ford engineers will now be able to download this data from the Newtonsto a laptop at the end of each day, and have the results available within in anhour for daily debriefings. When work initially began with Ford on this project, there was investigation inusing off the shelf forms packages, but it was realized Ford would needsomething more flexible and robust.  Ford engineers met AllPen at a briefingarranged by Apple representative Nancy Kelley, and began negotiations whichresulted in a $100,000 contract for AllPen. Wayne Yurtin, co-founder of AllPen Software noted, "The Ford project is anexcellent example of how the Newton 2.0 operating system in conjunction withthe MessagePad 130's backlight technology and increased performance is theperfect solution for vertical Fortune 500 PDA-based needs."  NEED NEWTON DEVELOPERS?^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ NewtNews, a freeware Internet based newsletter that focuses on the Apple Newtonand related technologies, is providing potential Apple Newton vertical andhorizontal market application builders a list of Internet based Newtondevelopers.

NewtApp - AN APPLICATION FRAMEWORK     ??     ??         Henry Cate - Newton DTS Engineer           ??         ??            One of the exciting features of the Newton 2.0 Operating                       System is a framework for building full featured         ??            applications very quickly.  The NewtApp framework                       provides protos which do many of the common actionsfound in applications on a Newton device, for example filing, finding,rounting, scrolling, displaying and overview, and soup management. For applications which store data as single entries in a soup and display thedata to the user in views, NewtApp may make the job of developing anapplication much easier. NewtApp is great for many form-based applications. Onthe other hand NewtApp is not designed for multi-soup based applications, orapplications which do not use a soup. One way to get started in using NewtApp is to following the NewtApp Q&A whichleads a developer through the process of building a simple NewtApp. TheCheckBook sample shows a more complex, full featured NewtApp.  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^*  LAUGH--             Why has the 2.0 OS revolutionized apps for the medical       (X  X)          field?       @@    @@         They have finally found a device that can read a                       doctor's handwriting!!        @@@@ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^*  PREMIER INTEGRATOR   CONGRATULATIONS MAXIM SOFTWARE!         **        ****            Congratulations go to Maxim Software, SFA for being     ***********        this month's winner of the Newton Systems Group's       *** ***          Premier Integrator award.      ***   ***                        Newton contract for Argentina's largest pharmaceuticalcompany.

Shot Logger captures key information about        *               each take while the shoot is happening, and allows                        users to determine on the set which footage to digitizewith nonlinear editing systems.  The result?  The tedious step of reviewing rawfootage prior to digitizing has been eliminated, and users can go from set toedit instantly. Taking advantage of wireless technology, Shot Logger transmits timecodes fromthe source directly to a MessagePad.  In addition to accurately loggingtimecode "in" and "out" points for each take, Shot Logger allows users to rateeach take, enter detailed scene descriptions, numbers and notes, and export alist of preferred shots for instant digitizing to nonlinear editing systems. "Shot Logger fills one of the biggest needs that I have as a director andproducer-- saving time and money," said Michael Savino, Vice President ofProduction Magic.  "When nonlinear editing systems came into being a few yearsago they dramatically improved the post-production process, but there was stillone major flaw--logging the footage to determine what should be uploaded forediting.  In this industry, we're always fighting the clock.  The time it takesto review raw footage is almost as long as the time it took to shoot it in thefirst place.  With Shot Logger, I can literally walk off the set and begindigitizing the raw footage... instantly." The selected takes can be instantly uploaded to nonlinear editing systems usingthe included LoggerLink software.  Shot Logger lists import to: Avid-MediaComposer, Data Translation- Media 100, Scitex-Videocube, Adobe Premiere,Panasonic Post Box, and Fast Video Machine. Headquartered in Colchester Vermont, Production Magic, Inc. is a collaborationbetween Michael Savino, a national and international award winning producer anddirector, and two Vermont companies: Green Mountain Software Corporation, whichspecializes in the development of pen-based computing applications, andCambridge Engineering, Inc. which specializes in wireless technologies.  Theprivately held company was formed in 1995. For more information on Shot Logger, contact Mike Savino, Vice President, atProduction Magic at 802) 864-0278 or at Info@ProductionMagic.com.  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^*     CALENDAR          MARK YOUR CALENDAR!!     |X X X X X|        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^     |# # # # #|       *The Newton Systems Group will have a presence in the     |# # # # #|        following upcoming events:     |# # # # #| ** Comdex Spring                  June 3-6                  Chicago, IL ** PC Expo                        June 18-20                New York, NY If you are presenting Newton Solutions at a tradeshow or event, please let usknow at tapped.in@applelink.apple.com. * NEWTON PROGRAMMING COURSES - from Newton Systems Group Developer Training  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^With the great early success of Newton 2.0, now is the time to takeadvantage of the Newton 2.0 Developer Training offered through AppleDeveloper University.
