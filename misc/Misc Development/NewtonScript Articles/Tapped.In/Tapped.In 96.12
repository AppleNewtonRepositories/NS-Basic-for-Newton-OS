When didyou start?SR: I joined the group in 1992 as a Product Marketing Manager. This wasjust about a year before we launched the original Newton. The division wasthen called "PIE" (Personal Interactive Electronics). A lot has changedsince.TI: And, what is your role today?SR: I manage our business development efforts for our corporate andvertical markets.TI: What does that include?SR: In general, we develop new business opportunities for utilizing Newtontechnology. But, it has a number of aspects:First, we place an emphasis on establishing presence in vertical marketsincluding healthcare, field maintenance, sales force automation, andtransportation industries.We also manage relationships at corporate accounts requiring a high degreeof pre- and post- sales support for technology evaluation and projectmanagement/ custom programming.In addition, we provide sales support & interface between the NewtonSystems Group and external partners ( Apple sales, VAR's, SystemIntegrators, and Manufacturing Reps).Lastly, we try to recruit necessary partners in development of a wholeproduct solution.TI: What's a "whole product solution" and where do partners fit in?SR: Well, the Newton is a great technology that in many cases just needsmore "arms and legs". Whether this be for barcoding applications, variouscommunications options, or connecting to a back-end legacy system.... thisis where our System Integrators and VAR's round out the product offering.TI: And do you have examples of how this works?SR: Sure. From large accounts, to very specialized VAR's. Your 'VendorSplendor' has profiled many each month. The readers of Tapped-In know this.They're the people ensuring our success.TI: ....thoughts for the future?SR: In a word; bright! The new MP 2000 is getting great reviews andacceptance. We've been inundated with requests for evaluation units andprojects.TI: Thanks for you time and information to our readers.^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^* MARKETING FRONT* CAROL SCHEUER, SOLUTIONS MARKETING MANAGERWhat is your role in NSG?My role in NSG is Solutions Marketing Manager for the mobile businessprofessional. I see my role having a dual focus, one which covers solutionsfor the mobile user, and the other, which covers solutions for the businessprofessional.Part of my role is to work with Solution Providers to enable the coresolutions needed by all mobile users which includes business professionals,educators, and field workers. Some of these solutions fall into thecategory of personal information managers and include calendars,schedulers, organizers, contact managers, and financial management tools.Other core solutions needed by all mobile users include internet and emailaccess. My colleague, Don Davis, who will be featured in our next issue ofTappedIn, will cover the internet and email solutions in his role asSolutions Marketing Manager for Emerging Technologies.In addition to needing PIM solutions, mobile business professionals needproductivity solutions which include word processors, spreadsheets anddatabase access. I will work with Solution Providers to further thedevelopment of the solutions we have today, as well as identify other keysolutions that this market requires. Given the importance of informationexchange between handheld and desktop computer solutions, my role willinclude a focus on desktop connectivity solutions.It's an exciting time to be a part of the Newton Systems Group. I lookforward to furthering the momentum on our new products by facilitatingcompelling solutions which will truly differentiate Newton as the productof choice.^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^* VENDOR SPLENDOR*    TBS & POWER MEDIA, INC. REVIEWEDTBS^^^^^^Based in Belper, Derbyshire, TBS specializes in all areas of mobile datadistribution, this includes Emergency Services applications, Health andSafety and Quality audit systems, field service systems and Sales andMarketing systems.Developed by TBS over the past two years, AuditMaster provides an easy touse solution to the age old problem of creation and control ofAudit/Inspection forms. It does this by making use of the Newton MessagePadhandheld computer to complete the field Audit and a PC based audit formbuilder and sophisticated scheduler. Using this new technology to performaudit/inspection work brings a degree of control and dependability neverexperienced before.AuditMaster allows the generation of sophisticated audit questionnairesusing the AuditMaster Builder . Then using the AuditMaster Scheduler auditquestionnaires can be grouped , scheduled and then allocated to anappropriate auditor's Newton MessagePad to conduct the audit. Once theaudits have been completed a report can be printed locally and theinformation is passed back to the AuditMaster Scheduler for analysis andstorage. Any remedial visits can be logged into the scheduler to be passedback to the appropriate field staff on the day of the diary appointmentalong with the remedial audit requirements. AuditMaster can be used in avariety of applications, such as Health and Safety, Quality, WorkplaceAssessment, Damage Assessment, Insurance Underwriting, Building Inspection,and Market Research etc.A later addition to the TBS product list is TaskMaster.TaskMaster provides the field service engineer all the elements required tocomplete any service job effectively. The field engineer enters service jobinformation on the Newton MessagePad. When a job is complete the engineerthen transmits the information using wireless GSM and fast-connect ISDNback to the Host, which is then updated with the latest information.This includes: Job allocation, Timesheets, Parts used and stock control,Product fault history and description, Engineer status messaging, EngineerHints and Tips, Call close.TaskMaster also allows the use of barcode readers for parts informationrecording and printers for receipts and delivery notes.TaskMaster is currently in pilot phase with Hewlett Packard, who have fieldengineers across the whole of the UK.For more information on the TBS products and services:Call +44 (0) 1773-828766,Fax +44 (0) 1773-829939,eMail sales@tbssystems.co.uk,or visit the TBS web site at http://www.tbssystems.co.uk/tbsnewt.POWER MEDIA, INC.^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^POWER MEDIA, INC. was originally founded in 1993 as a publishing andadvertising firm specializing in providing small companies with a bigimage. With a focus on the handheld PDA software market, PMI has workedwith several prominent developers of shareware Newton software, includingStand Alone, Inc. the developers of the many popular titles. Including;-Dateman: the popular integrated contact manager-Fax Cover Creator: the fax cover creation utility for Newton-Order Form: the handheld invoicing and inventory programIn addition to providing packaging, manuals, sales classes, in storedisplays and print ads, PMI works with the developers on user-interfaceissues. We have extensive experience with PDA developers anduser-interfaces dating back to the initial release of the originalMessagePad. Currently, PMI is working with developers on a variety ofprojects for SI/VAR and commercial release for the MessagePads 130 and 2000as well as the new education eMate.PMI currently has 18 commercial titles with five more appearing worldwideby the end of January. With the experience gained in working in the PDAsoftware market, PowerMedia has many potential projects waiting for interested developers. Anydevelopers looking to be commercially published, or who wish to work oncommercial projects are encouraged to send email to devinfo@powermedia.com.Information on all Power Media projects is available at our web site atwww.powermedia.com/~pmi or call 503-684-8232 for more information.^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^* SI ACCESS*MP130 SLIDES FOR YOUR ADS^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Are you an SI, or VAR in need of a photo to use in your advertisements ordata sheets? We have just the thing - 35mm color slide of a MessagePad 130.If you'd like one, please send an email message totapped.in@newton.apple.com^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^*LAUGH*MESSAGEPAD REVEALS TOO MUCH FOR THIS NEWTON USER!Some details of your busy, busy life are perhaps better left unrecorded inthis digital age. That's the lesson being doled out to a San Jose, CA. drugdealer whose Apple MessagePad was recovered by local police.  The contentsof the Newton helped police in prosecuting the drug dealer thanks to therecords he kept in his MessagePad.^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^* TECHIE TIP*      DEBUGGING WITH A SERIAL PC CARDRyan Robertson, Newton DTS EngineerDebugging without the inspector can be difficult; especially when it'scommunications code. This month's techie tip will show you how to use aserial PC card as a second serial port for your communications application.1) Modify your endpoint's instantiate options to use a PCMCIA slot insteadof the built-in serial port. Here is the option you should add:{type:   'option,label:  kCMOSerialHWChipLoc,opCode: opSetRequired,form:   'template,result: nil,data:   {argList: [kHWLocPCMCIASlot1, 0],        // or kHWLocPCMCIASlot2typeList: ['struct, ['array, 'char, 4], 'uLong]}}This option must in the options array directly after the endpoint serviceoption.2) Connect the inspector to the built-in serial port as you normally would.3) Enjoy hours of endpoint debugging. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^* TOP PROJECT*  PA CONSULTING GETS HIGH MARKS FOR THEIR JUDGING SYSTEMWhat happens when PA Consulting in London, England is called upon toreplace an archaic pen and paper judging system?  The results are a Newtonbased solution that offers more accuracy and saves time for British Design& Art Direction (D&AD).  D&AD is a charity which manages competitionsthroughout the year to judge work produced by companies from the arts anddesign fields, and disseminates the very best work to stimulate andencourage creative staff and students.   The judging of such competitionshas traditionally been a paper and pen process with a computer system onlybeing used to print out  judging sheets  from a database.  For 1996, therewere about 16,000 entries, to be assessed by 130 judges over a period ofsixweeks.PA consulting was commissioned at short notice to design and develop avoting system based on Newton PDAs.  Before the start of each judgingsession, the entries were downloaded from the main database into a set ofApple MessagePads. Each of the judges was given a MessagePad to record hisor her vote on each of the entries.  At the end of the session, the voteswere uploaded and the results printed out.The Newton-based solution enabled D&AD to cope with a record number ofentries on a tight schedule, and reduce the number of errors in recordingthe votes.Graham Fink, President of the D&AD was delighted with the results.  "Wewere used to judging on paper at D&AD. In fact, only five out of 120 judgeshad ever held a Newton before, after 10 minutes everyone fell in love withit. With over 15,000 pieces of work to judge and votes to count, I'd say itspeeded up the process by around 90%." said Fink.For more information about this project or PA Consulting, contact NickRushby at +44 1444 243092 or nick.rushby@pa-consulting.com^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^*CALENDARMARK YOUR CALENDAR!!|X X X X X||# # # # #|     * The Newton Systems Group will have a presence in|# # # # #|     the following upcoming events:|# # # # #|MacWorld San Francisco: January 7-10    San Francisco, CAMacintosh Platform showcase for the west coast.
