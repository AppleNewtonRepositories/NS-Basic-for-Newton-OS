DEVELOPER RELATIONS@	Q: What does the Newton Developer Relations Group do?@ | /@@	@	A: The Newton Developer Relations group is responsible@	for delivering a wide variety of developer supportservices, including technical and marketing supportto third-party developers. On the technical side, Developer Relations manages Newton Developer Support Programs, provides early seed units and beta software seeds to developers, and orchestrates events that support developers access to new technology. On the business and marketing side, Developer Relations works one-on-one with developers to help them bring products to market. Our team also acts as an advocate for developers providing co-marketing and promotional opportunities. We leverage resources throughout Apple on the marketing and engineering perspective for use by the developer community wherever possible. Developer Relations also plans and manages the Newton developer conferences. For more information, send email to PIEDRG@applelink.apple.com or PIESYSOP@applelink.apple.com^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ o MARKETING FRONT	INTERVIEW WITH EMILIO ROBLES, SR. MGR, PUBLIC RELATIONSXX	Q: What role does public relations play in the NewtonXX	Products division?XXXX XX	A: We work in conjunction with the product divisionXXX	to publicize and promote the MessagePad and theNewton platform primarily through the press andanalysts channels, with an aim to influencing the coverage received. To this end, we have a number of programs in place including editorial product seeding; success story identification, development and placement; and a speaker's bureau whereby we place Newton staff at appropriate industry conferences. With a view to promoting the Newton platform as a whole, we work with Newton licensees and third party developers to incorporate their products and messages into our press materials and communiques. Public relations also acts as a filter between the product division and the press/analyst community, creating and disseminating key messages and official company statements regarding product plans, divisional strategies and corporate direction. As part of that effort, we act as spokespeople on certain issues, answering questions, fact checking stories and flagging potential issues. We also develop the spokespeople within the division, preparing them for interviews and press briefings. By establishing solid relationships with the editorial community, public relations is better positioned to encourage balanced coverage of the products, programs and strategies within the Newton products division. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ o VENDOR SPLENDOR	EX MACHINA AND SUNBIRD REVIEWEDVV	VVVV	VV	Ex Machina, Inc. is a communications software developerVV VV	that currently has three Newton software products.VV VV	POCKETCALL is a commercial terminal program. WorkingVVV	together with a cellular-compatible modem (such as theMotorola CELLect Card, which plugs right into a Motorola flip phone), PocketCall will let you dial into any text-based computer system. NOTIFY! for Newton is a paging application that adds the command "Page" to your action menu, along with Print, Mail, etc. When connected to a phone line, it lets you send full text messages (or notes, calendar appointments, addresses, whatever) to any full text pager on any paging system. It also works great with UPDATE! for Newton, which is receiving software shipped as part of the Apple Mobile Message System. Update! (with the paging receiver card included with the AMMS package), or the Newton itself (with the original Newton MessageCard) will let you receive pages and wireless messages right into your Newton InBox. PocketCall is available direct or from Newton dealers. Notify! is available from Apple Dealers, and Update! is available as part of the AMMS from Apple dealers, but may be released as stand-alone product. For more information, contact Scott Samios at 212-843-0000 ext 12. ^^^^^^^^^^^^SUNBIRD RUGGEDIZED CASESWell-designed and easily fit on your Newton, the Heavy Duty Case (HDC) is made of black or colored skin-effect polyurethane foam. Thanks to a large velcro handstrap at the back allowing firm hand-grip, the HDC provides the Newton with constant protection, particularly efficient when used in difficult conditions (weather, drop risks...) The HDC offers not only security to your Newton but also the possibility of adding several hand-held devices: a printer, radio, radio modem, bar-code scanner, wireless LAN...can be set and combined in a special "AddOn" box fixed on the HDC.

Some developers who make new versions of their??	??	Newton applications want to distribute "patches".??	The goal is often to send a small package to??	customers which will easily complement the current?	product, but contain only the changes since the lastversion. Unlike desktop file systems, when applicationsare installed on a Newton, they are treated as virtual read-only objects ("psuedo-ROM"). Since you cannot actually change the data in the original package once it is installed, traditional patching is not possible on installed packages.If you anticipate specific changes to your application, you could write your application to be patchable. For instance, imagine you had a function which calculated tables of tax data. If you suspected that the table definitions might change due to new tax laws, you could check for a "patch" function in a root view slot to be installed by a future package. If it is available, your app should call it using 'call with' (otherwise call the one from your package). This will allow you to write your application now but distribute a small package later which installs this function in the root view to update your app's behavior.^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ o LAUGH--	--AT US, NOT WITH US(X X)Q: Will EtherNet for Newton be available in April?@@ @@@@@@	A: If the EtherBunny brings it!^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ o PREMIER INTEGRATOR CONGRATULATIONS PDA DIMENSIONS! **	Atlanta-based PDA Dimensions is a software developer****	and systems integrator focused on the research,***********	development, and deployment of custom vertical*** **	handheld software solutions.
