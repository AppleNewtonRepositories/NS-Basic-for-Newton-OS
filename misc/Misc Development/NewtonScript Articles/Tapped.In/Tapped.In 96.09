Can you tell us about the NSG'S retail channel    | *     * |               marketing program and your roll within NSG?    | *     * |    | * * * * |             A. I am responsible for implementing many ofthe channel marketing programs that    |____@____|       facilitate the sale of Newton products at the retaillevel.    |_________|Q. What makes up NSG's retail channel marketing?A. NSG's merchandising, detailing, sales programs and tools are designed toprovide Newton based products with exposure at all levels of the retailenvironment.  They are broken down as follows:*Merchandising.        NSG merchandising consists of the creation and ongoing productionof marketing materials dedicated to the retail environment.  Traditionally,this has included the MessagePad point-of-purchase display(POP) and thosemarketing materials attached to, or directly related to it.*Detailing.        Whereas merchandising revolves around the "creation" of retailmarketing materials, detailing is the program's implementation phase.Usually carried out every 1-3 months, a detailing "wave" consists ofsending temporary representatives out into the field to refresh Newton'spresence in retail storefronts.  These reps are generally employees of aspecific detailing firm that contracts with Newton for field services.Detailing at the storefront level consists of the rep making contact withthe store or department manager, setting up new POP or modifying theexisting POP with updated merchandising materials and loading ormaintaining the interactive demo application software.  It is also veryimportant to provide store personnel with updated information regardingNewton programs such as the Fax back program, any current promotionalprograms, and the demo and employee purchase programs.  At the conclusionof each detailing wave a summary report is produced by the detailingcompany outlining and graphing the information compiled from individualcall reports.  This report is received by NSG for review by marketing andsales.*Sales Promotional Programs        Conceived with the belief that a knowledgeable sales rep is aneffective sales rep, the various sales promotional programs have beendesigned to motivate and educate retail sales reps interested in theMessagePad product.  There are currently four individual programs in place;The Newton Champion Program, Employee Purchase Program, the Demo PurchaseProgram and the Reseller Fax-BackProgram.*Sales Tools        The term "Sales Tools" describes a wide variety of programs andinformation used to educate those sales people who are standing in front ofthe customer trying to make a sale.  Whether they are a retail rep or anApple business development manager, the people selling Newton products needup to date marketing and sales information in easy to understand and usefulformats.  We provide everything from hard-bound booklets full of productcomparisons, SKU information, and press releases, to Appleproduced CD ROM's that include product and platform demos for the Apple andNewton sales force.^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^*   MARKETING FRONT      JOE HAYASHI, PRODUCT MARKETING MANAGER, INTERNET              XX             XX          Q. What is your role in the Newton Systems Group?            XX      XX   XX            A. My mission in life is to ensure that the Newtonis a first-class Internet/Intranet         XXX                   platform. This involves defining Internetproducts and technologies we need to ship,                                    bundle, or otherwise include withNewton products. Given the tremendous potential                                    that the Internet and Intranetsrepresent for us, it's an exciting time to be at NSG.Q: What projects are you working on?A: One of my main functions is to help define future versions the NewtonInternet Enabler. Look for new versions of our stack to provide bettersecurity, improved performance, and more transports. We realize that all ofour Internet developers rely on NIE to be as solid as possible and we'reworking hard to make it a great foundation on which to provideInternet/Intranet solutions to customers.Besides NIE, there are a variety of other Internet technologies which wewill eventually make part of the platform. Our goal in this effort is tohelp developers bring seamless Internet solutions to market faster.Last, but certainly not least, I'm working on Newton Java. We're still inthe early stages of this effort, but we're extremely excited about Java'spotential for us as well as for the whole computing industry.^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^* VENDOR SPLENDOR    VV       VV     VV     VV          INS-INTEGRATED NETWORK SOLUTIONS      VV   VV           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^       VV VV            INS, located in Innsbruck, Austria was set up atthe beginning of 1995 as an        VVV               independent  business from a large technicalmedical group in order to develop                               sophisticated IT solutions for the technicalmedical sector.  Some examples of the various INS projects are as follows:Online-information and booking systems for beds, operation reservations ondata accessing machines for the hospital sector, and the ELIAS system,which represents a comprehensive information system for doctors. The endmachine for doctors is based on an MP 130.  In response to demand forflexible and simple applications for mobile data accessing, severaladditions to the Newton Message Pad have been developed.The Newton Connection Center (NCC) undoubtedly constitutes the mostremarkable development.  With the aid of NCC, the demand for more simpleintegration of the Message Pad in existing surroundings has finally becomea reality.  The NCC fulfills several functions: it is not simply arecharger but is much more a flexible communication unit.  Via the built-inIR interface in the NCC, the Message Pad can exchange data with othermachines, which are connected to the NCC's serial interface, withoutirritating cable connections.  The built-in electronics ensure asafeguarded and documented transfer between machines.  Both the insertedMessage Pad as well as an externally connected Mac or PC can access theoptional integrated modem in the NCC. Various application possibilities areavailable in both vertical- and horizontal market: health sector, servicearea, industry, consumer, etc.  In a word, every application in which datamust be exchanged between mobile and stationary units.Programming the NCC has become extremely simple.  The NCC-Enabler,developed by INS, represents an API and it is therefore completely simpleto expand new or already existing programs around the IR function. In theprocess the NCC-Enabler takes care of the entire IR data flow.  Theintegrated electronics in the NCC make it just as possible to communicatewith pluged-in machines (Mac, PC, Printer, Modem, Keyboard, etc.) as with anormal serial interface.  A special protocol is not necessary for this.  Acouple of examples of existing NCC compatible applications are the IR-Termand IR-Keyboard.For further information about the NCC or other INS products please contacton +43-512-563973-0 or fax on +43-512-563973-20 or you can even contact byE-Mail <INS.COM@applelink.apple.com>MEGAHERTZ & WYND COMMUNICATIONS^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Megahertz, the Mobile Communications Division of U. S. Robotics, and SanLuis Obispo, CA-based Wynd Communications Corporation together providerobust two-way wireless messaging to MessagePad users. The AllPointsWireless PC Card, manufactured by Megahertz, fits into the Newton's PCMCIAslot. Coupled with WyndMail from Wynd Communications Corporation, theAllPoints Wireless PC Card enables Newton users to easily send and receivee-mail to any Internet address, send faxes to any fax machine, even sendtext-to-voice messages to any ordinary telephone--all without cords,cables, or phone lines."The AllPoints card and WyndMail has been an exciting combination forNewton users," says Bob Kimball, Chief Technology Officer for WyndCommunications. "For the first time, MessagePad owners have a simple,plug-and-play solution for sending and receiving wireless messages."WyndMail uses the Newton's universal in-box so there's no effort on thepart of the user to receive messages. When a message is received, theNewton chimes and it simply appears in the in-box. With WyndMail as anoption on the routing button, sending messages is just as simple. The usersimply selects "WyndMail" as the routing option and, after addressing, themessage is instantly transmitted via the AllPoints card.The AllPoints Wireless PC Card transfers data to and from the Newton usingpacket radio technology. This makes it impervious to the dropped calls andother interrupted transmissions associated with cellular modems. Messagesare exchanged across the RAM Mobile Data system, a network of radio towersthat provide coverage in 93% of the metropolitan areas and airports in theU. S. This allows seamless nationwide communication with without roamingcharges."The AllPoints Wireless PC Card allows Newton users on the move-fieldservice workers, mobile sales forces, and other mobile professionals-toeasily communicate and receive time-sensitive information." said RandyDence, Megahertz Director of Wireless Marketing.The Mobile Communications Division of U. S. Robotics (formerly Megahertz)is a wholly-owned subsidiary and a leading provider of solutions-orientedmobile data communications products including PC Card data/fax modems, PCCard Ethernet/modems, PC Card Ethernet adapters, and cellular and wirelesstechnologies.

They arefound only in New Zealand and are        * * *          one of the world's rarest birds.  There are only 50kakapos left,  of which about 6 are        *               breeding  females. All the kakapos are knownindividually and have been given names        *               like Nora, Felix and Gumboots. DOC has mounted anextensive program to monitor and        *               preserve the species. The birds have recently beenmoved to three off-shore islands                        which have been cleared of predators like rats.DOC have three Newton projects in development for the kakapos. It is vitalto know if the birds are breeding, so technicians built electronic eggswith thermometers and radio transmitters in them. These 'eggs' are placedin the kakapo nests where they are readily accepted by the birds. Every 15minutes or so, the temperature of the kakapo's hot bottom is transmitted toa receiver which then logs the data on the Newton.The Newtons are also used for tracking kakapo movements. All the birds havetiny transmitters on them which broadcast a unique signal. DOC staff useportable radio aerials to find the approximate bearing and record it on theNewton. The bearing is drawn graphically onto a map of the island. Overtime, a complete plan of each kakapo's movements can be compiled.The third project records every time a kakapo approaches its nest. Eachnest has a proximity sensor nearby capable of detecting the kakapo'ssignal. The proximity sensors can only hold a limited amount ofinformation, so periodically DOC staff go around each sensor and downloadthe information into the Newton.The director of the Kakapo Unit, Graeme Elliott, says that the easyportability of the Newton was a major consideration when purchasing theunits. All equipment has to be backpacked into the island so the low weightis a big bonus. The Newtons can work for quite reasonable periods of timeon lithium batteries which is vital since there is no electrical power onthe island. The backlighting of the 130s was also valuable, as stafffrequently have to use the Newtons at night or in dimly lit tents. Elliottsaid an attempt was made to use GPS units for positioning but they werefound to be too unreliable under the dense forest canopy.The software is being developed by Simon & Associates for the Department ofConservation in Nelson, New Zealand. The program was made possible by agrant from Comalco.
