Tactile is offering a wireless printer and driver bundle for Newton developers to incorporate into their vertical market applications. The printer measures 7.3 x 3.6 x 2.4 inches and runs on four AA batteries. It prints one 24 character line per second on thermal receipt paper measuring 2.25 inches wide. The printer receives information transmitted from the Newton's built-in IR port at a range of 10-36 inches. The driver comes supplied with an API for programmers to call from within their own application. The $200 bundle includes the printer and one licensed copy of the driver. Cost for additional licenses are determined based on quantity.

So you're writing an App for the Newton that's using??	??	Serial Comms to talk to an application running on??	your Mac. Calling FlushOutput after each Output??	call ensures that the data gets pushed out the?	serial port as soon as possible. Meanwhile the Mac issending data to the Newton causing yourInputSpec to befired and you want to be able to send a reply to the Mac from within the InputSpec. Bang! You're dead! If a FlushOutput call is in progress when your InputSpec fires you could run into a situation where the Newton becomes totally wedged. There is a simple trick you can use to prevent this! Put a slot called "FlushActive" in your endPoint frame, set it to 0 when your endpoint is instantiated, and call this function instead of FlushOutput: func(ep)beginif ep:FlushActive = 0 thenbeginep:FlushActive := ep:FlushActive + 1;ep:FlushOutput()ep:FlushActive := ep:FlushActive - 1;endendThis will make sure that there is never a chance that FlushOutput gets called while another FlushOutput is in progress. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ o LAUGH--	--AT US, NOT WITH US(X X)Q: How do you tell an INTROVERTED Newton software@@ @@	engineer from an EXTROVERTED Newton software@@@@	engineer?A: The extrovert looks at YOUR shoes while you'retalking.^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ o PREMIER INTEGRATOR CONGRATULATIONS PENVISION! **	PenVision Information Systems, Inc., is an Edison,****	New Jersey based systems integrator specializing in***********	hand-held, wireless, pen-based solutions for vertical*** **	markets.

The next Annual|# # # # #|	Apple USA Newton Symposium will be held Thursday,|# # # # #|	January 11, 1996. That's the same week as MacWorldSan Francisco (Jan 9-13), so if you're going to that,you can take our complimentary bus down to Cupertino for the day on Thursday. It will be just like last year, an all-day (8:00am-8:00pm) event held at Apple's R&D Campus. Stay tuned, more information to come! ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ o ADMINISTRIVIA:	We're now called Newton Systems Group!00000 00000	No more Apple PIE! We recently decided to change our0	00	0	name from PIE (Personal Interactive Electronics) to00000 00000	NSG (Newton Systems Group). We found that Newton isbecoming such a recognized name, that it made moresense to reference the entire group with Newton in the title. You may have heard that Apple had a reorganization recently. The Newton Systems Group was not affected at all; in fact we have more commitment from our executive staff now than ever before! Stay tuned for lots of exciting developments in the years to come from the Newton Systems Group!! ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ For back issues or to be on our mailing list, link TAPPED.IN or Teri DAHLBECK. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
