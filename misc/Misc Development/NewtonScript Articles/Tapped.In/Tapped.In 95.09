This support ranges from teaching the                         basics of Newton programming to answering questions                         throughout the complete development cycle. DIG is composed of two groups: Developer Training and Developer TechnicalSupport (DTS).  Developer Training creates and maintains the Newton Programmingcurriculum.  Currently we offer classroom-based courses for introductorytopics.  We're also working on the development of self-paced courses withinstructor on-line support for advanced topics.  Look for these self-pacedcourses early next year. Newton DTS works primarily with Newton developers by answering theirdevelopment questions.  The support is done via e-mail, with the NewtonPartners and Associates+ developers sending e-mail directly to Newton DTS.To support the rest of the development community, DTS engineers cruiseAppleLink, eWorld, "the net" and other on-line services as best they can toanswer questions.  Newton DTS is also responsible for writing Q&As, samplecode and articles published in the Newton Technology Journal. Then there is the NewtonSysOp, who manages content and access for oursupport areas in AppleLink, eWorld, and other on-line services, manages thequarterly Newton Developer CD, maintains the Newton signature registrationdatabases and serves as a general line of communication between Apple andNewton developers. Within Newton engineering DIG, in conjuction with the Developer RelationsGroups, acts as the voice of the developer; we provide the developer'sperspective in the design of the Newton OS, APIs, as well as the developmenttools. Overall, DIG is committed to the success of the Newton platform by supportingdevelopers' efforts to create killer applications. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^o   INSIDE NSG         BRIAN SCHUSSLER, NEWTON ONLINE MGMT, DEVELOPER RELATIONS              XX             XX         Q:  What is your role with Newton Online Management?            XX      XX   XX           A:  Online communications is an important component of        XXX                 the Newton Systems Group's overall communications                            strategy.  It provides an efficient, global, andcost-effective way for us to communicate with our customers and businesspartners.  My responsibility is split between two main areas; consumers andthird party software developers.  With the public, we try to educate them onhow Newton technology can provide solutions for real world problems.  Our goalswith developers are slightly more complex - we want to demonstrate to potentialdevelopers the Newton platform's excellence as a development environment whileproviding existing developers with resources and technical information fortheir development efforts. To communicate with consumers, we maintain Newton areas on AppleLink, eWorld,and the Web (coming soon).  These areas contain a variety of Newton platforminformation including: press releases; Apple, third party, and licensee productinfo; demo software; a calendar of Newton events; SI/VAR information; andFrequently Asked Questions.  eWorld also contains discussion boards, ashareware software library, and hosts two live weekly conferences - Newton'sCoffee for consumers and Llama Talk for developers.  A small subset of theinformation in Apple's online locations is provided to the Newton forums onAmerica Online and Compuserve.  Some of the challenges we face are designingonline areas so information is easy to locate and selecting content that isuseful to the target audience. At present we maintain a private developer area on AppleLink for members of oursupport programs.  As a component of the AppleLink to eWorld migration effort,a public Newton developer area is being built on eWorld. This is in addition tothe private one for support program members.  A public developer web site isplanned after the AppleLink to eWorld migration is complete. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^o VENDOR SPLENDOR       JOEY, NEWTONSOURCE AND MAC-BARCODE REVIEWED    VV       VV     VV     VV          Joey Technologies, Inc.      VV   VV           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^       VV VV            After eighteen months of extensive development, Joey        VVV             Technologies has officially released Joey, a Newton                        forms creation program.  Working with either aMacintosh or Windows compatible PC, Joey allows you to quickly and easilycreate your own data entry, storage and retrieval forms. With Joey, the Apple MessagePad becomes a mobile data collection devise thateasily exchanges data between the MessagePad and a desktop computer.  The datathat's exchanged can originate from and return to a number of popular databaseformats on Macintosh, PC and mainframe platforms.  Once your data collectionformats have been designed and transferred to a MessagePad, you're ready foron-site data collection.  In addition, software development companies andsolution providers can utilize Joey to expedite Newton forms generationdevelopment. For more information on how Joey can assist in designing data collection formsfor your Newton contact Joey Technologies, Inc. at (216) 792-3131 or by fax at(216) 792-3545. NewtonSource^^^^^^^^^^^^^NewtonSource, the innovative Newton-only reseller has retail stores in primelocations in New York City, San Francisco and Los Angeles, with two more toopen in Chicago and Boston in the fourth quarter '95.

If you need to include a lot of read-only data in a           ??           package, the easiest way to do so is often to create         ??             a large array filled with the data.  An obvious way to                        do this is to create a text file and include it in the         ??             project, where the file looks something like this: DefConst('kMmyData, [{partNo: 12, name: "frobbit", cost: 12.98},{partNo: 17, name: "grommet tie", cost: 0.13},... hundreds or thousands of frames ...]); Compiling such a file can take a long time, because the array constructor inthe compiler is inefficient at handling very large arrays.  You can typicallycut the build time of your project to a fraction of the time the above wouldtake (one project dropped from 40 minutes per build to 7 minutes) by rewritingthe file to look like this: constant kMyData := [];AddArraySlot(kMyData, {partNo: 12, name: "frobbit", cost: 12.98});AddArraySlot(kMyData, {partNo: 17, name: "grommet tie", cost: 0.13});... hundreds or thousands of frames ... The same problem (with the same sort of solution) exists for frames with verymany slots.  See the article "Lost in Space" for more information on includingread-only data in a project, as well as information about frame maps andsharing them. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^o  LAUGH--              --AT US, NOT WITH US       (X  X)                        Three Newton MessagePad users died and went to Heaven.      @@    @@          As they were standing before the gates, St. Peter        @@@@            appeared and said, "I want each of you to write on your                        MessagePad your noblest achievement while you were on                        earth."  After they had done this, he had them readtheir achievements out loud.  They were all quite impressive.  The first onesaid, "I helped administer medication to third-world countries" which St. Petertranslated to mean that hundreds of thousands of lives had been spared sicknessand death.  The second one said, "I donated my entire inheritance to anorphanage" which St. Peter translated to mean hundreds of children would besheltered and clothed.  Finally he turned to the third MessagePad user whosaid, "Can you give me a minute?  I know I did something important, I justcan't read it." *  Want your name in Tapped.In?

What they                     did know was that there was a critical need for mobilehome health care professionals to capture patient information electronically.To date, ClinTrak (renamed ClinPen) is being used by customers in five states,and within the next year will be deployed nationwide. MSS chose Green Mountain Software because it was looking for experienced Newtondevelopers to work with its team.  Another important aspect was that thedevelopers be knowledgeable in three key areas:  communication protocols, userinterfaces and large systems projects. In providing management services to hospital-based home health care agencies,MSS was driven by the need to consistently beat out its competition inprocessing Medicare, Medicaid and insurance claims.  With ClinPen, nurses usean Apple MessagePad to record clinical data, patient visit status, mileage,medical supplies and patient information in the home.  Each day, nurses linkinto one of MSS's satellite servers and send patient information gathered fromthe previous day's visits, as well as retrieving the next daily schedule ofvisits.  For every four nurses out in the field, ClinPen eliminates the needfor one full-time person to enter patient information into the company'sUNIX-based database.  Even more beneficial, patient records are now at a muchhigher accuracy level, and billing information is obtained within a 24-hourturn-around cycle. For more information on ClinPen or Green Mountain Software's customdevelopment services, contact Ann Pettyjohn at (802) 865-2728 or atAnn@GreenMtnSW.com. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^o  PREMIER INTEGRATOR   CONGRATULATIONS PHYSIX INC.!         **        ****            Physix Inc. offers a full-featured mobile electronic     ***********        medical record with an intuitive user interface.
