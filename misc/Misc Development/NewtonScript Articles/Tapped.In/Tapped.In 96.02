I work with    |____@____|          a very small group of people that produce the "core"    |_________|          NewtonScript system: the compiler, interpreter, and                         runtime support code.  Of course, this code is used inthe Newton OS itself, but other groups also use it in products such as NewtonToolkit and Newton Connection. One part of this job is to make lots of little decisions about the languagedesign.  People often have good reasons for wanting a change in the language,but that has to be balanced with the desire to keep the language simple andeffective for everybody. Q: What projects have you worked on lately? I wrote the native NewtonScript compiler that shipped in Newton Toolkit 1.5.Although we are working on C++ tools, NewtonScript is still the most naturaland productive language for Newton programming, so I wanted to make it possibleto get the performance of native code without having to write in C++. For the 2.0 OS, I spent a lot of time improving the speed of the NewtonScriptinterpreter.  Of course, the performance of the interpreter affects theperformance of every Newton application, so it was worth a big time investment.The new interpreter is a lot faster (20 times faster in my favorite contrivedbenchmark, 3-5 times faster for more normal code). ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^o   MARKETING FRONT   JEN DUNVAN, MANAGER, NEWTON DEVELOPER TRAINING              XX             XX       Q: What new programming courses are being offered for                         Newton developers?            XX      XX   XX         A: With the great early success of Newton 2.0, now is the        XXX              time to take advantage of the Newton 2.0 Developer                         Training courses offered through Apple DeveloperUniversity.

RCU consists of software for the Macintosh or Windows PCand a package for the MessagePad.  The connection can be made via serial cableor AppleTalk (Mac only).  Users simply launch RCU on both ends (desktop andMessagePad) and press "Connect" on both ends.  A few seconds later the link ismade and users can immediately begin browsing, adding, deleting, or modifyingthe data on the MessagePad.  While no data actually resides on the desktop, atab-delimited text file can be imported to the MessagePad or, conversely,exported back to the desktop. While RCU 1.x limits users to the built-in applications, version 2.0 givesusers and developers desktop access to any soup.  This is done through aseparate text file called "ADF" (application definition file).  By modifyingthe ADF in the System's Preferences folder, users can specify which soups RCUshould get access to, as well as specify different or multiple overviews.  Forexample, the Names application's default overview lists the Name and Telephone.Users can create an overview that lists a Name and E-mail account, or a Nameand Birthday.  You don't need to be a programmer to modify the ADF file, butNewton developers will find it plenty powerful. For more information on RCU 2.0 and other Revelar products, contactsales@revelar.com or call 800-669-5191. LANDWARE^^^^^^^^LandWare, Inc. is now shipping proCALC Ex, a fully programmable scientific andbusiness calculator application for the Newton 1.x and 2.0 operating systems.This powerful problem solver offers both RPN or SAN input logic options.  Ithas the aesthetic and functional emulation of a "real" calculator and includesover 85 built-in functions including statistics (with linear regression andestimation), an optional finance plug-in (with FV, PV, PMT, n, i) and a modulararchitecture.  LandWare will soon be publishing an API to allow systemintegrators to develop custom plug-in modules.  proCALC Ex also has very modeststorage requirements (63K, CodeEditor:30K).  Currently it is being bundled withanother LandWare application, proCALC 12c. For more information on proCALC Ex and proCALC 12c, contact LandWare at(201) 347-0031, info@landware.com, or http://www.landware.com. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^o  SI ACCESS            CONTEST DEADLINE EXTENDED!!        @@               o Newton Value Story Contest Deadline Extended     @@  @@             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^       @@               Do you have an anecdotal story about how Newton has        |               been beneficial to you?

Maurice Sharp - Newton Developer Tech Support     ??     ??           ??           It used to be that a package with a nasty InstallScript         ??             could result in someone erasing the entire store while                        attempting to get their MessagePad to boot.  With the         ??             advent of Newton 2.0, this is no longer a problem. Now you can prevent all the packages on an entire store from activating.  Justreset the unit and hold down the pen in the lower left 1/4 inch of the screen.You can then click "no" in the slip that asks about activating packages.  Onceyou do that the packages for that store will still show up in the ExtrasDrawer, but now there will be a large X through them.  You can then scrub theoffending package and reboot.  The same trick can be used to activate a card. See the upcoming article "Shift Key" in the next issue of the NewtonTechnology Journal for more information and a more advanced trick. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^o  LAUGH--              --AT US, NOT WITH US       (X  X)                        The following Call-of-the-Day was submitted by Apple      @@    @@          Assistance Center agent Barb Kelley in Sterling,                        Colorado:        @@@@                        A customer wanted help performing surgery on his AppleMessagePad 110 because the screen had cracked below the top layer.

In mid-1995,      ***   ***         PenUltimate determined that the combination of the                        coming Newton 2.0 O/S with Apple's MessagePad hardwarewould finally be able to deliver the sophisticated applications and trueportability which mobile users demanded but were not fully able to realize withtheir notebook computers.  Leveraging upon its extensive experience as adeveloper of enterprise-wide, sales automation solutions for Windows-basedenvironments, PenUltimate developed Locomotion for the Newton 2.0 platform anda complimentary Windows-based component.  The total solution is designed toenable Newton 2.0 users to exchange and synchronize data with their favoritePC-based database solutions such as ELAN Software's GoldMine, while providingpowerful and extensive data management capabilities on the MessagePad. We congratulate PenUltimate on the quality of its software development and itscommitment to the Newton platform! ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^o  TOP PROJECT       SELLING CARS WITH STETON TECHNOLOGY GROUP!   ***********        *     *      Steton Technology Group of Austin, TX has partnered with        *     *      Cardone Enterprises, the leading automotive sales training        * * *        firm in the U.S., to create a suite of Newton-based        *            applications for new car dealerships.  The "Coach" is        *            designed to lead sales consultants through a disciplined,                     professional sales process including: building a buyerprofile, identifying buyer needs, recording demonstration drive results,streamlining the purchase and delivery processes along with a comprehensiveclient follow-up. The Coach also enables dealership sales consultants to access inventory andquote finance/lease payments that previously required a visit to the salesmanager's office.  This reduces the manager/salesman go-between that buyersdislike so much and turns the ordinary car salesman into a professional salesconsultant. Manufacturers now recognize the need for dramatic changes in the way theirfranchise dealers retail automobiles.  In response to consumer dissatisfaction,manufacturers are requiring dealers to change the way they handle customers andimprove customer satisfaction across the board.  The Coach offers manufacturersthe ability to impose their sales standards on the independent franchisedealers that sell their brands.  For example, the Coach contains full vehicleproduct data and comparisons against competitive models.  This increases boththe knowledge depth and breadth of sales consultants. For more information on the Coach and other Steton products contact SteveCaplin, marketing director at Caplin@Steton.com or (512) 331-5714. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^o     CALENDAR          MARK YOUR CALENDAR!!     |X X X X X|     |# # # # #|        o The Newton Systems Group will have a presence in     |# # # # #|        the following upcoming events:     |# # # # #| oo Field and Sales Automation                  February 20-21    San Jose, CAApple Computer will be participating at the upcoming Field and Sales AutomationShow with a 30x30 booth.
