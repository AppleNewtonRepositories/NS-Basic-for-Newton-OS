MGR.@	Q: Who will provide paging service for the Newton@ | /@	products?@ |/ @@	@	A: Apple has opened up the market for the Newton@	platform paging solutions by licensing back theApple Messaging Card driver and applications to Motorola so that they can use it with their NewsCard PCMCIA paging product and offer this solution to any service provider who wants to support the Newton platform products. Further paging solutions are expected from a wide variety of service providers in the future.Q: What is the Apple Mobile Messaging Service? A: The Mobile Message System is a hardware and software bundle for MessagePad, PowerBooks and Windows-compatible notebook computers which allows customers to receive short and long one way wireless page messages, news updates, and a variety of other information via a nationwide paging network. The Apple Mobile Message System includes a PageCard wireless message receiver with LCD screen from Socket Communications; and Update! receive software and Notify! send software from Ex Machina. The bundle also includes a coupon allowing the customer to sign up for the Apple Notification Service, a "one-stop" activation, billing, and support program. The Apple notification service uses PageNet's nationwide wireless network and wireless gateway services by The National Dispatch Center, Inc.Q: How do I develop vertical applications that take advantage of the paging cards and networks that are out there?A: For the Apple Newton Message card and the NewsCard available from Motorola, there is an API available from Apple that will allow 3rd parties to develop applications that take advantage of 1 way messaging. This API is only available from Apple as part of the PIE Partners Developer Program. In addition, Ex Machina (212-843-0000) has an API available for their Notify! and Update! applications for sending and receiving paging messages in conjunction with the Socket Page card.Q: What capabilities do the new modem tools allow? A: In conjunction with 3rd parties, Apple has been working to develop the modem enabler and provide modem setup package sample code that will open up the Newton platform to 3rd party landline and wireless cellular data/fax modems. These modem tools will be made available to the development community. Q: What are the Newton modem enablers and set-up packages? A: The modem enabler is provided by Apple, and once downloaded into a Newton based product, opens up the modem preference to allow users to pick different modem setup packages from 3rd party modem vendors. The modem setup package sample code will be available to the 3rd party developers in the Newton developer program. The sample code will allow them to create specific modem setup packages for their particular modem. Q: How can customers obtain the Newton modem enablers and set-up packages? A: Currently the Motorola setup packages, Hayes-compatible and Hayes Error Correction set-up packages are now available. Other packages from AT&T and APEX will become available shortly. They can be obtained using a personal computer, modem, and the Newton Connection Kit or a serial cable, through the following online services: eWorld, AppleLink, America OnLine, CompuServe, Genie, and the Internet at: Info.Hed.Apple.Com. Q: What is the communications driver development kit (DDK) and when will developers have access to this C++ code for development? A: The communications DDK involves access to low level C++ tools that will allow 3rd party developers who are developing native protocols for the various types of wireless (sessionless) communications networks, such as ARDIS, RAM and RF spread spectrum LANS. We have been selectively seeding and working with a few key 3rd parties to test the low level C tools and help support the development of native drivers and transport protocols. One example of this is ARDIS. ARDIS announced that it would make their driver development kit available to the development community at no charge in the first half of 1995. Q: How do you get the driver kits for ARDIS, RAM and Metricom? A. In order for a Newton-based product to connect to a vendor's network, they need to go through a Radio-based modem. They're packet-based, therefore there has to be low-level drivers developed that allow MessagePads to speak to the native protocols for the various RF Packet networks. ARDIS has announced that it is working on a driver kit for SI's and 3rd party developers in mid-1995. Contact Claire Cosgrove, ARDIS, (708) 913-4235. RAM is working in conjunction with GDT Software to develop a software development kit for SI's and 3rd party developers. Contact Kurt Christopherson, (415) 357-3604. Metricom is also in development and can reached by calling Sandy Gordon at 408-399-8165. Q: How do I get my applications to take advantage of the wireless LAN products that are available today?A: All 3 of the wireless LAN products that are available today are based on AppleTalk: the Dayna Roamer RF LAN product, Digital Ocean's Grouper RF-LAN product, and Photonic's Cooperative Transceiver IR (InfraRed) LAN Product. If applications can take advantage of Appletalk, here's a way to do it wirelessly. ooEditor's Note: We're sad to say that Susan Schuman has decided to leave Apple Computer. However, she is starting her own consulting company, Schuman Associates, and will be available to you for marketing and communications consulting on an hourly basis (after 2/6/95). She can be reached at (415) 469-8700. She'll be missed GREATLY but we wish her best of luck in her new endeavor!!oo^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ o MARKETING FRONT	INTERVIEW WITH IVY MILLMAN, STARCORE GLOBAL MANAGERXX	Q: What benefits are there for STARCORE and SystemsXX	Integrators to work together?XXXX XX	A: STARCORE publishes and distributes titles for theXXX	Newton platform. There are many ways SI's and STARCOREcan work together to provide customer solutions: 1) Consider including a STARCORE title as incremental value-added to your custom solution. For example, if you're building a SalesAutomation system, you may want to include Expense Plus rather than developing your own expense reporting solution. Expense Plus currently connects to Mac or Windows and can be customized to connect directly to a customer's application. 2) Consider having STARCORE commercialize segments of your custom solutions. Through either publishing, co-publishing, or affiliate label relationships, SI's may increase their ROI by productizing solutions and working with STARCORE to reach the broader marketplace. For more information, contact Ivy at Applelink MILLMAN1 and she will forward your inquiry to the appropriate STARCORE team member. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ o VENDOR SPLENDOR	SKYNOTES, INC.

Based on Xircom's NetWave(tm) technology, the new PCMCIA adapter is a fully integrated, protocol independent, spread spectrum, frequency hopping radio. It is the fastest and most reliable solution available today, and provides a direct connection to an Ethernet LAN or a peer-to-peer connection from a Newton to a Macintosh or Windows. Current users of Dayna's Serial Roamer can upgrade free to a PCMCIA adapter when the product becomes available in Q2, 1995.^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ o SI ACCESS	SI Demo CD-Submissions Due By February 28!!@@	ATTENTION ALL SI's! The highly demanded SI DEMO CD@@ @@	is in the process of being created. ALL SI's are@@	requested to donate their best vertical demo.|	GUIDELINES: Have a 'splash screen' with your company's|===	name and phone number in the beginning of the demo.Make sure that the application can easily be removed if a user wishes (no special patches, etc.). Enclose an electronic read-me file with TWO parts: 1) How the presenter should 'position' the demo--include what type of customer would use the application, why they would use it, cost/benefit issues, and other relevant information. 2) How to 'demonstrate' the application-- step-by-step instructions with any pertinent information along the way. Read-me files should be 2 pages or less. Application size can be as large as you like, but we recommend keeping it to a minimum necessary for an effective demo. DON'T FORGET to put 'dummy' data in the application so that the presenter has a story to tell that the audience can relate to. Link Tapped.In with your package, or if you have any questions.

You can check for free space on a store using??	??	store:TotalSize() and store:UsedSize(). You can??	check available NewtonScript memory using stats(),??	immediately preceded by gc() (normally used only in?	debugging). In general, developers do not need tocheck available memory because exceptions handlers areuseful for memory problems, and Newton memory availability is difficult to rely on. If you check for both 'NewtonScript memory' and 'free space on a store', neither value promises that all the memory is available to allocate. Write your application normally, surrounding relevant parts of your code with exception handlers. For instance, surround your soup:Add() message with exception handlers to handle the "the store is full" exception. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ o LAUGH--	--AT US, NOT WITH US(X X)	This month's joke compliments of Developer Rob Bruce:@@ @@	TOP TEN LIST:@@@@	"Things Heard at a SLIMY Newton Singles Bar"10) Your charging station or mine?9) I'll give you a beam tomorrow.8) I'm all charged up, are you ready to go? 7) Of course I recognize you!6) Is that a stylus in your pocket or are you just glad to see me? 5) Nice double A's you've got there!4) Let me slip off this battery door and reset into something more comfortable 3) I'm a fully upgradable socketed guy, keeping up with the times. 2) Wanna see my stealth stylus?1) Hay babi, warts harpening.^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ o PREMIER INTEGRATOR CONGRATULATIONS Bear River Associates! **	Bear River Associates provides systems integration,****	software development, consulting, and developer***********	training for Newton and all the standard desktop*** **	platforms (Mac, Windows, OS/2).
