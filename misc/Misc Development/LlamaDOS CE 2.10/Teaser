LlamaDOS: The first Post-Newton Command Line InterpreterWhile the Newton is a tremendous design, it lacks one important feature: a command line interface for system management. Rather than invent a new interface for the Newton, LlamaDOS implements the world’s most widely used interface, with well over 40 million users: DOS. The developers at RegSoft have done their best to make sure that the quality and user friendliness of the DOS interface survived intact on the Newton in their new product, LlamaDOS 1.06.With LlamaDOS, a user can traverse directories, look at files and the status of their system using the same commands they have used for years on PC’s. Of course, not all commands are implemented: just a subset that will be used regularly. Any application can also be run directly from the command line.LlamaDOS is shareware: see the Library section to get your copy today!
