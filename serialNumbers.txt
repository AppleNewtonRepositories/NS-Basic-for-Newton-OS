I realised recently that whilst the previous version of thie file contained code which would generate serial numbers which would appear to work, something wasn't quite right, so I went back to searching again. In the MainView file, there's a very similar but sufficiently different routine for checking serial numbers which actually seems to work this time.

Inside there I searched the source for "serial" and found the routine to check it: (x-1000001)%23=0

I generated my own serial number by choosing a number, 20, multiplying it by 23 and adding 1000001, which gave me 1000461.

And that serial finally works in NS Basic to make the app work properly :)
